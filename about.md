![beach](/images/beach.png){:height="300px" width="400px"}






- I'm a researcher, aspiring [boffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boffin), [mango](https://github.com/kammitama5/kammitama5.github.io/blob/master/images/mango1.png) and cocoa picker. I love encryption, fairness (both as a metric and in terms of (access to) resources), statistics, machine learning and functional programming (I am at the intersection of the cryptography and AI/ML/fairness communities). Most recently, I've also become interested by Information Theory, courtesy of a class I audited on decentralized consensus protocols (Stanford Winter 2021), which covered tradeoffs in several blockchain protocols, and am currently taking a programming workshop on file formats, manipulating data and digital compression (Spring 2021). I'm also taking an Information Theory Course (Fall 2021), which I was instrumental in having offered, as our school does not have an Information Theory department.
- I am currently working on research at the intersection of Provable Fairness, Differential Privacy / Applied Cryptography, Information Theory and Data. My current tools are anything from Python, R, Matlab, SageMaths, Haskell, Rust, LaTeX, a calculator, mechanical pencils and paper. I am a Systems thinker.
- Also a book junkie. Love Haskell, Hackerspaces, puzzles, making and sailing. 

### What's Unique about me
- I have the unique perspective of being an immigrant (and green card holder), having been through many pipelines of school, having work experience and having lived in locations and groups where my representation was quite scarce (both in terms of knowledge, having work experience and demographics). My career has been in a breadth of typically niche, proprietary knowledge/ technologies (which is a nice way of saying I know a lot about things that are absolutely useless but I have great stories!).
- I would describe myself as intellectually curious. I've taken classes in sculpting, drafting, 3D modelling, woodworking, electronics (low voltage/high-voltage/PCB-milling), welding, machining, and robotics (I also taught a robotics class weekly for about a year). I've sailed from [MDR](https://www.visitmarinadelrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MDR-MDR-Anchorage-map-web.pdf) to Catalina Island, and to Newport beach. I like Haskell and programming languages in general, which I did not learn formally in school. I also worked in manufacturing for a couple startups, and understand the process of manufacturing real-world products (generating a BOM, 3-d modelling, ordering parts, bidding with client, etc). I believe that life experience/learning from failure is important.
- I see programming as a tool. I believe that coming from a different perspective is important in solving new problems in computer science, and I enjoy collaborating with people who are from various backgounds in research.

### Update (as of 2019)
- In Fall 19, I started PhD candidacy at the University of Vermont (my advisor is [Dr. Joseph P. Near](http://www.uvm.edu/~jnear/). My focus has been on Provable Fairness, Data Privacy (specifically [Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)) and Machine Learning and ways that privacy can work (is robust) and is verifiable (my lab focuses on provable privacy and security; privacy that works). In Fall 2021, I will be focusing on Applied Cryptography. I have also TA-ed for Data Privacy coursework (Python), a Programming for Engineers Matlab course (Matlab), 
a Compilers course in Haskell and another CS course.
- I'm open to Summer and Winter Research Internships, particularly as they relate to my topics of research, or Haskell in general, and I'll get back to you, even though it takes a while because I'm often really busy! :)

## More Updates...
- You can see a bit of my so far (quite busy) life in a blog post [here](https://kammitama5.github.io/Tuesday-October-8th/).
  There is still much time in the year to go! I love working hard and pushing myself, while helping others to reach their fullest potential!

## Awesome other things I used to enjoy!
- [Women's Sailing Association of Santa Monica Bay](https://wsasmb.org/): I was a member and raced in WOW-WAH twice (once on MyTime3 and another on Harmony).
- Hanging out at [Del Rey Yacht Club](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/off-to-the-sailboat-races-with-a-nearly-all-female-crew/a-ride-along-with-women-sailboat-racers-in-marina-del-rey): learn about the fact that they started because of exclusion from other yacht clubs! I sometimes raced in a boat there called Mexican Divorce.
