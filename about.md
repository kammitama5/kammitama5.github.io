- I'm a researcher and aspiring [boffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boffin). I love machine learning, encryption, ethics and functional programming (I am at the intersection of the cryptography, programming languages and AI/ML/fairness communities, and I'm particularly fascinated by Neural Networks).
- My precise focus can be described as Data Privacy (Differential Privacy) meets Fairness meets AI. In terms of Fairness,
  my focus draws from the technical aspects of computer science in Programming Languages (which has a rigid, provable method
  of what it means for something to work), and my critical film theory and art history (specifically, in Latin American political art), to question what it means for our data to be secure, what it means to encode trust, and what is ethical, considering margins of power that exist in the world.
- Also a book junkie. Love Haskell, Hackerspaces, puzzles, making and sailing. 

### What's Unique about me
- I have the unique perspective of being an immigrant (and green card holder), having been through many pipelines of school, having work experience and having lived in locations and groups where my representation was quite scarce (both in terms of knowledge, having work experience and demographics). My career has been in a breadth of typically niche, proprietary knowledge/ technologies (which is a nice way of saying I know a lot about things that are absolutely useless but I have great stories!).
- I would describe myself as intellectually curious. I've taken classes in sculpting, drafting, 3D modelling, woodworking, electronics (low voltage/high-voltage/PCB-milling), welding, machining, and robotics (I also taught a robotics class weekly for about a year). I've sailed from [MDR](https://www.visitmarinadelrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MDR-MDR-Anchorage-map-web.pdf) to Catalina Island, and to Newport beach. I like Haskell and programming languages in general, which I did not learn formally in school. I also worked in manufacturing for a couple startups, and understand the process of manufacturing real-world products (generating a BOM, 3-d modelling, ordering parts, bidding with client, etc). I believe that life experience/learning from failure is important.
- I see programming as a tool. I believe that coming from a different perspective is important in solving new problems in computer science, and I enjoy collaborating with people who are from various backgounds in research.

### Update (as of 2019)
- In Fall 19, I started PhD candidacy in Programming Languages Research at the University of Vermont (my advisor is [Dr. Joseph P. Near](http://www.uvm.edu/~jnear/)). My focus will be on Data Privacy (specifically [Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)) and Machine Learning and ways that privacy can work (is robust) and is verifiable (my lab focuses on provable privacy and security; privacy that works). I also TA-ed for Data Privacy coursework (Python), as well as a Programming for Engineers Matlab course (Matlab), and in Spring I'll
be TA-ing a Compilers course in Haskell and another CS course.
- I'm open to Summer and Winter Research Internships, particularly as they relate to my topics of research, or Haskell in general, and I'll get back to you, even though it takes a while because I'm often really busy! :)

## More Updates...
- You can see a bit of my so far (quite busy) life in a blog post [here](https://kammitama5.github.io/Tuesday-October-8th/).
  There is still much time in the year to go! I love working hard and pushing myself, while helping others to reach their fullest potential!

## Awesome other things I used to enjoy!
- [Women's Sailing Association of Santa Monica Bay](https://wsasmb.org/): I was a member and raced in WOW-WAH twice (once on MyTime3 and another on Harmony).
- Hanging out at [Del Rey Yacht Club](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/off-to-the-sailboat-races-with-a-nearly-all-female-crew/a-ride-along-with-women-sailboat-racers-in-marina-del-rey): learn about the fact that they started because of exclusion from other yacht clubs! I sometimes raced in a boat there called Mexican Divorce.
