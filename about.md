- I'm a programming languages researcher and aspiring [boffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boffin). I love machine learning, encryption, and functional programming (I am at the intersection of the cryptography, programming languages and AI/ML communities).
- Also a book junkie. Love Haskell, Hackerspaces, puzzles, making and sailing. 

### What's Unique about me
- I would describe myself as intellectually curious. I've taken classes in sculpting, drafting, 3D modelling, woodworking, electronics (low voltage/high-voltage/PCB-milling), welding, machining, and robotics (I also taught a robotics class weekly for about a year). I've sailed from [MDR](https://www.visitmarinadelrey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MDR-MDR-Anchorage-map-web.pdf) to Catalina Island, and to Newport beach. I like Haskell and programming languages in general, which I did not learn formally in school. I also worked in manufacturing for a couple startups, and understand the process of manufacturing real-world products (generating a BOM, 3-d modelling, ordering parts, bidding with client, etc). I believe that life experience/learning from failure is important.
- I see programming as a tool. I believe that coming from a different perspective is important in solving new problems in computer science, and I enjoy collaborating with people who are from various backgounds in research.

### Update (as of 2019)
- In Fall 19, I started PhD candidacy in Programming Languages Research at the University of Vermont (my advisors are [Dr. Joseph P. Near](http://www.uvm.edu/~jnear/) and [Dr. David Darais](http://david.darais.com/)). My focus will be on Data Privacy (specifically [Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)) and Machine Learning and ways that privacy can work and is verifiable (my lab focuses on provable privacy and security; privacy that works). I also TA-ed for Data Privacy coursework (Python), as well as a Programming for Engineers Matlab course (Matlab), and in Spring I'll
be TA-ing a Compilers course in Haskell and another CS course.
- I'm open to Summer and Winter Research Internships, particularly as they relate to my topics of research, or Haskell in general, and I'll get back to you, even though it takes a while because I'm often really busy! :)

## More Updates...
- You can see a bit of my so far (quite busy) life in a blog post [here](https://kammitama5.github.io/Tuesday-October-8th/).
  There is still much time in the year to go! I love working hard and pushing myself, while helping others to reach their fullest potential!
