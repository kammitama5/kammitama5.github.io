## My Last Day in Bonn Formalizing Maths

- We got to see a presentation on Naproche by Peter, a talk on Homotopy Type Theory by Steve Awodey, and we saw a
DeepMind talk on RL and Theorem Proving (which was at the Computer Science department). I wanted to hang out with
James, but I had to shoot him an email instead, as my friend and I got back late from lunch; I got to visit the [Mensa](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensa)
for the first time and have food there. It's basically cheap (in price), canteen food, with a wide variety and is pretty
healthy.

## Here are some Photos
