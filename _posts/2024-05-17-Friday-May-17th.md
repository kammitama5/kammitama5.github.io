## My Last Day in Bonn Formalizing Maths

- We got to see a presentation on Naproche by Peter, a talk on Homotopy Type Theory by Steve Awodey, and we saw a
DeepMind talk on RL and Theorem Proving (which was at the Computer Science department). I wanted to hang out with
James, but I had to shoot him an email instead, as my friend and I got back late from lunch; I got to visit the [Mensa](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensa)
for the first time and have food there. It's basically cheap (in price), canteen food, with a wide variety and is pretty
healthy.
- I headed out a bit early as I had three research meetings pretty much back to back, and hadn't realized how tired I was!
- It's been a really fun time, though; I would definitely love to visit Bonn again, for a longer period of time.
- Oh, and I am on this list of 120+ women "behind many of the technological innovations that we experience today" [link](https://www.ldv.co/blog/women-spearheading-advances-in-visual-tech-and-ai?mc_cid=1a09b11732&mc_eid=08b1ff825a).
A dream accomplished; I'm super grateful for the acknowledgement. It was really unexpected, and I was in disbelief, but
I honestly love what I do and have been enjoying research with the people I'm working with at the moment.

## Going forward
- Besides my grad Maths workshop, I may have to be less active during summer, but we'll see. Maybe I'll just post
some sTeX and Naproche stuff and side projects or general thoughts kind of things. You know how internships are;
companies generally don't like persons revealing information, locations, etc, so it may be tougher to post in general,
but we'll see.


## That's it
