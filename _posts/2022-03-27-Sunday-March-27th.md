## Two Proofs and a Lady

## Sorry
- I just really liked the title :) In a bit of a mood. 
- I did a fair number of proofs this week, but this is my life now I guess. We didn't end up having grad seminar this week, but I
was super happy anyways because I got to chat with one of my mentors instead, and catch up with another friend who is coming to vist me!
I am so excited!
- A couple things of note that my mentor advised me is that I should not think of a PhD as this lofty thing which can lead to (if I am not doing
things perfectly) failure, but rather a space for experimentation. I definitely feel this these days, and I'm a lot happier than when I started
in that sense because you also realize that not everyone comes in at the starting line, too. There are students who do come in to be set up 
ahead of everyone else, or to be groomed for certain opportunities that others are not. There is neglect, and there is regret. 
- Humans, as a friend mentioned this week, like to see potential in persons who remind them of themselves, so there's that, too. And if there
aren't already a lot of people who traditionally are in grad school like yourself, good luck finding mentors! Unconsciously, you may find that
seniors grapple with what to do with you, or how to support you. They have little to no context for this. I still think that part of the solution
is to admit coming from a place of ignorance with respect to this, but Academia can convince persons with the title of "senior" to think that showing
a lack of wisdom in a situation can be viewed as a sign of weakness, so you may get overconfidence and bad advice instead. Be wary for your own sake;
if you are ill-advised, learn from it. I think whether to call them out on it is a judgment call (my opinion, open to debate on this). Some seniors take
this badly, in that their ego gets in the way if you say "hey, you were wrong about this", and others will take it for what it is. This is the forest of
egos and prestige, in a world where many were told from a young age they were going to excel and that they are special and know things, so retaliation
from bruised egos and a stubborness to prove academic righteousness is a thing. Coming from the world of work, some of this is funny to me, and I think that
sometimes these people could benefit from a day of pouring concrete, doing customer service or digging ditches, but I digress.
Anyways, It's a lot more challenging being from a smaller demographic not traditionally represented in Academia than getting support
from some senior advisors who "see a bit of themselves (when they were younger) in you" (because basically they are all from your background..all of them).
- There is a lot
of inexperience, because well, advisors are human and many make a lot of mistakes along the way, and their students further along in their journey
get the benefit of all the experience and things they had to figure out that earlier students did not. There is a bit of luck involved in terms of
research topic and payoff, too. There are so many things can play into things working out, and you would drive yourself nuts if you were to think
about it. As much as one would like to think it's this meritocratic space, there is also an incredible amount of unfairness. I like to think about
it as more of a tipping of scales; how can one increase their odds to gain leverage to do the things they want to do? There is a lot of that going
around, which means that if you do achieve some of those odds, you may find that you suddenly have a lot of persons in your company who see you
as a good investment or a means to an end. It's definitely a chess game. I totally understand why people come out with the right kind of skills for
leadership positions, even if they don't have *all* the skills to be a leader. It shapes your mind to focus on the details of your field, while
keeping track of all the "big picture" things you need to navigate that space. If you can't do both, it becomes painfully obvious, and well, your students 
(and research) will suffer.
- Most importantly, there is finite time, so it's really important to not waste your students' time and have a plan. Speaking of plans, this is pretty
wild, but I went down a list of things I had made a while ago and realized I had achieved every one! So the plan thing really works (at least I think so)!

## I got snacks!

- The BlackComputeHER Conference sent us (Fellows) some snacks! I regrettably have almost eaten mine out already!
- Apparently I was able to find some fancy plantain chips, guava chips and coconut water, as well as some sweet corn chips
that are supposed to be like arepas or something. They were really great is all I can remember! And then they were gone :(
So I got more! I also got a bunch of teas because well, tea-person (waves).

## I got into another graduate Pure Maths summer school!!
- I am so excited! It's the Park City summer [school](https://www.ias.edu/pcmi/2022-graduate-summer-school-course-descriptions) focused on Computational Number Theory. There are isogenies and crypto lectures and 
in total, it will be around 300 of us! I received full funding, too! How awesome!? And on top of that, my advisor will be there, too!
I couldn't be happier!
- It's been a dream for me of attending, too! I don't know why, but it feels like this particular community has been so welcoming, and I love it!
- The parts where we use computers are also more my kind of jam, too. I really like doing things with numbers moreso than building applications.
It took me SO long to figure this out when I started learning computer things because that was the advice I was given by most; "learn to build
the applications and do the web things", and I was like "no, I want to just work on small puzzles all day". As it turns out, you can do this!
There is space for this, too, in the field!
- Oh, and my Pure Maths grad student friends apparently refer to me as having "Hermione energy", which is the nicest thing anyone has said to me
this past week! I updated my "about me" page to reflect this! :)

## Stuff
- Elliptic Curves: l-adic (Automorphisms), Weil Pairing and Tate Module.
- Algebra IV: did about 5 smaller proofs for this class. I also gave some notes to people this week because that's what nice people do when their
friends miss class! I know we did some Eisenstein Irreducibility stuff and Direct / Inverse Limits aka Projective / Injective.
- Random Prob Graphs: Random Walks (1D) and [Stirling Approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation). I am doing homework for this over the next few days.
- Combinatorics seminar: I saw a cool talk on C4 graphs and trivial bounds for ```B_k(g)```. Learned about [Sidon Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon_sequence).
- Number Theory: looked at Euler's Totient (proof of), Mobius involution.
- Did research meeting with advisor. She promised to give me notes on Topology! I tell you I would be here for another 10 more years to learn all the 
Pure Maths things!

## Other
- I also went to this seminar by Mathematicians in a three letter company and this guy named William gave a talk on cryptology and [Kerckhoff's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle),
and referred to what I am working on as "fancy math" with elliptic curves, which is pretty funny. He was so passionate about cryptology and Pure
Mathematics. It was kind of awesome. I also read about some of the first black cryptologists [there](https://permanent.fdlp.gov/LPS23465/invisible_cryptologists.pdf).
- I've been working on a proposal for a month now, and have about another month to submit, so I've been slowly chipping away at reading the papers
and stuff for that. It's super interesting, and I often have to tell myself to stop thinking about it so I try to minimize tabs when I am not working
on it. I generally love writing proposals and grant things and do them on my own when something interesting pops up (and if I have the time).
- Oh, I reviewed an article for a friend, in of all things, Haskell! And omg the code worked! I am always surprised by this, because I always tell
myself I don't know coding things really well, because quite frankly I enjoy solving puzzles more than building applications. I started going back
into doing CodeWars (but haven't posted my solutions like I used to in the github repo), and I'm still pretty up there in terms of ranking (currently
in the top ```.3%``` (point three percent) of all users on the platform), even though I haven't been there in a while. Solving puzzles is an itch I have to scratch, but I don't
think I'd be happy building say, a web application or whatever. And that was part of my consideration for grad school. I much more enjoy what I'm
doing more, because it's more along the lines of the solving puzzles in the way I like than in other capacities I may have liked less (and been 
unhappy about, even though yes, I know those jobs pay well, too).
- Very funny observation: someone pointed out that they only know software engineers who own houses, and I laughed. That's completely not true.
Perhaps most of your friends are software engineers? At this point, I know a number of persons across fields who own houses (some more than one!)
and aren't in software. It's a very attainable goal in software (the timeline is shorter, it's easier to switch from another field), but it isn't the only way. 
Some friends make more than software engineers, too! Some are retired already, in my age group. Some have private chefs; I don't think I've 
met software engineers who regularly have this, btw. Some will never buy a house because they aren't interested / it isn't a goal for them.
Software eng is not a career that is associated with getting to know power structures at the highest level unless you "manager up", and that has its
tradeoffs. Being clear about what goals you want to accomplish (is being a role-model important, is power and fame important? Is having a family important)
is a better metre of prospective happiness than "this makes a lot of money", even though, yes, it *can* be a start, particularly for those who do not
come from a background of privilege. I have also met several persons who *did* come from privilege who *loathed* software engineering or would never
consider it, because prestige and having access to power at the highest levels of society runs deep in their family name and heritage, and that is where they seek validation.
Do what you love, or find a way to do it. If you change your mind, that's fine, too. One of the things I'd really like to do moving forward in my 
career is not be caught up in such a bubble where I can only see the perspectives of people within my field. I would lose my mind because I loathe
insular circle-jerking. Life is fun when people along the way can challenge the way you think, or engage in meaningful discussions with you.

## So that's it
