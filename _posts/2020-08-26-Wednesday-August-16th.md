## Optimizing your week as a Virtual PhD student

## Thinking
- One of the things I've really been thinking a lot about was how to add order into the chaos of existing and getting work done virtually.
  I am often *incredibly* busy, and when my virtual schedule first started, I noticed that my productivity hours flipped; I prefer to stay up
  really late and get late. 
- While this is dependent on the person, I've been asking around about various tips and tricks people have done to stay sane working and living
  in the same environment. 
- During one of my fellowships this summer, one of the founders of a company said that pre-frontal cortex rest is super important. You need time
  to think that is focused and interrupted, and it is for this reason that they go to sleep by 8pm. They also get up early because many persons
  are not up then, so they can get focused work done. 
  
## Optimal times
- The founder mentioned that it's good to figure out when you are most productive. During my summer internship, I was fortunate to have access to 
  tools that would track this for me (I am not a subscriber on my own of such products). It gave me insight into a lot of my habits. 
- I am *not* a morning person. I was raised as one, but I'm really not at my best at this time. I grew up working late night shows in theatres and
  shooting [splits](https://standincentral.com/2018/10/31/what-are-splits/) that would start at 8pm and go until 4am. Therefore, I realized over
  summer that expecting productivity or work at 8am was near-impossible for me.
- I started doing things like reading in the mornings instead, because it was a low-effort task for me. This has seemed to work.
- I like working really late at night when it is quiet, and when I won't be interrupted. So this has seemed to work for me. 

## Blocking off times
- I am a habitual email-checker. This is *bad*. I learned over summer, with advice from my manager over summer and labmates from another lab
  that I should train persons I work with to expect responses from me at times of the day. Professors are great at this. Instead, my manager
  said that I should block off specific times to check my email, and then leave it along otherwise.
- Similarly, during the times of focused work, avoid distractions. My advisor has a laptop with no browsers, that he uses when he is working.
  Another postdoc friend said that he simply leaves his phone in another room, and another said they turn off their phone. This was easier for 
  me when I had a flip phone, to be honest. But thank you airplane mode.
- Also, as others suggest, [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

## Taking breaks
- One of my coworkers this summer would go for a run in the middle of the day. I learned over summer that I very easily got tired of virtual 
  meetings and conferencing, so I would take an hour in the middle of the day, turn off the lights, put my electronics to sleep or off, and 
  take a nap. This worked wonders and energized me for my tasks for the rest of the day.
- Also, as I had said before, I work best nocturnally, so it gave me energy to get work done when everyone else had gone to sleep.
  
## Just say no
- This has been the most difficult thing for me to do, to be honest. It's easy for me to say yes to helping to organize a thing, or speak at a thing,
  or to contribute in some way, because it lines up with my personality and my values. But it can be exhausting and overwhelming. 
  I'm still struggling with this, but I'm getting better over time. 
- I've gotten better at saying no to certain blocks of time, though (just say you're not available during these times, which are your focused times).

## Alienation
- I listen to [podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-do-grad-school/id1521767027). It's a low-effort way to have some noise
  in the room without having the distraction of music.
- I also have lab-time, am on some Slack groups and this summer was able to be in groups that had virtual games, virtual chats, Twitch streams,
  Improv sessions, virtual yoga, and I even joined a [reading](https://www.wendyssubway.com/programs/reading-groups/abolition-reading-group-end-to-political-policing) 
  and a [writing group](https://www.wendyssubway.com/programs/events/writing-night).
  
## A lot of this is common sense
- But it's really difficult to implement, especially if you're a good person. But it's really important, especially during the time of virtual time,
  to protect your time and your energy.
  
## And that's it
