## I Can't Stop thinking about this

## I began this reading group
- I'm taking this reading group at the moment that I really don't think has any Computer Science people in it. 
  Every week, we are assigned about two to four articles, typically from books, and we have discussions on them.
  The topic is Abolitionist Insurgency. At first, I was joking with another professor that "they use bigger words
  than we do in Computer Science". But I've been thinking about it a lot.

## I've felt like something is missing
- I've felt like even though I'm learning a lot of this technical specialty, in another dimension, it is lacking
  in depth. I can't have the kinds of conversations we have in my reading group with the people in my major / specialization,
  at least not on the surface level. In fact, a lot of things feel like they're on the surface level in Computer Science,
  but in a way that's hard to describe.
- When I attended the first session, I felt like someone told me to look down and there was a gaping hole below me. I just
  haven't found those kinds of conversations among computer scientists, and I honestly felt like a child. I felt like I
  could only communicate with the language of a ten year old, and everyone around me was an adult, so erudite and layered
  in their thinking. It made me immediately aware of the gaping hole of Computer Science education.
- We don't process things. We don't take the time to think *deeply*. And it shows in our products.
- We who can code (I can barely do so; that's why I'm focusing on research and am not really a software engineer per se) see
  ourselves as often of high intellect, of boundless ability. But stepping into that sort of space made me realize why we 
  flatten the ideas of other fields. I've been thinking about that a lot, as it's been coming up again and again in spaces like
  data and AI. We flatten the ideas of other fields because we only see the surface, and we pat ourselves on the back for bad copies.
  
## Bad copies of someone else
- This reminded me of being a budding concept design student, learning digital painting. A famous concept designer would become
  the hip one that everyone wanted to be able to draw like, and then a slew of students would copy, very badly, the style of 
  that hip concept designer. But they couldn't really replicate it because the reason the concept designer's style was so interesting
  was because they're well, them. It took them years to get to that place, and their style is influenced by all the people who
  influenced them on their journey; you couldn't really replicate that by just looking at their work and without the experience.
- I'm beginning to feel like some parts of computer science are like that. They stitch together ideas from other fields...but badly.
  They don't stay engaged long enough in those fields to really understand and commit to why those problems were approached in that way,
  and to engage in the study of those before them, too.
- And it's painfully obvious when you are confronted with the veracity of study in those other fields. It just doesn't measure up.
  You feel like a toddler. 
  
## I have no idea what to do with this
- I've been thinking about this a lot. It feels disatisfying. But I don't want to put down computer science; I'm learning a lot 
  and I'm grateful for that. But a part of me tells me that this isn't all I am. I do like a lot of the tech and computer science
  culture, but it's very difficult (or rather, rare) to find spaces like this reading space in there. And it's strange and makes
  me very concerned but not surprised about why these spaces (at least not on the surface) don't exist in tech. 
- I guess one can say that they understand why some of these companies are now considering things such as ethics in tech, or 
  intersectionality. But it's strange because to me, these are the questions *anyone* who is curious about identity and meaning
  eventually asks oneself. Weird.
  
## That's all I have to say
