## Quantum Math Summer School Building Night

## I Finally got to build my Snapology
- Snapology is actually due to Dave Honda; you can see his work [here](http://snaporigami.weebly.com/).
- Today we had lectures from Irani, Fefferman and Haah. Apparently Pommersheim was in space cadet mode (as all mathematicians are
from time to time) and left his bag of sunchips lying around,
so I ate them, because there weren't any more left in the snacks area. I was telling someone that "I had to settle for Pommersheim's sun chips" that
he left and then I saw him looking over at me, surprised (So that's where they went! haha).
- I was given permission to eat them because apparently Pommersheim also took a bottle of water and forgot he was drinking it and just dunked it
over his head instead or something, I heard. So the sun chips were pretty much a go, everyone said, as they didn't think he would come back for
them.
- It is very fun here! And there are mathematicians who walk around bare-footed, write on
whiteboards and blackboards, and it's just been a great time. I'm going to miss walking in the morning with the group at 7:30am, too.
- I saw some codes from Haah today that reminded me of Gr√∂bner basis stuff from Taylor's class and
ascending chains. It's been popping up everywhere; this
weekend someone mentioned annihilation, which reminded me of when Taylor taught [Annihilators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilator_(ring_theory))
in class. So nice to see things coming in handy from Algebra 4, although that was a class I definitely need to have the pleasure of taking again
if I ever get the opportunity to do so. I do have access to the notes and whatnot, but it's a pretty advanced Graduate Mathematics class, as was
the DiffGeo class he taught. It's nice to see material having an overlap with this area.

## These are some of the things we built tonight

## More Stuff coming soon!

- We're supposedly going star-gazing, back to the slides, and to a show with Olympic athletes doing stunts with skis and stuff!


## That's it for now
