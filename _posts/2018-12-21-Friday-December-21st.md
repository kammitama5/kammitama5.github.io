## I'm participating in L'Space in 2019

## What it means

- It's not for credit but it's a programme meant for undergrads where we spend 
  1.5 hours a week being mentored by NASA scientists and engineers, and 
  we have a group project to do with a team of other students (that should be
  in the neighbourhood of 6 to 8 hours a week of work). It's all done Virtually,
  although I may have some CAD and stuff to do (we will be given a design challenge
  that is mission-specific, and have to work out the details with our team, under
  mentorship).
  
- It's a great opportunity for me, particularly because it is exactly research
  experience, and in a team setting! So score! It starts January 17th.
  
## I went to the Chinese Lights Festival yesterday

- My Norwegian niece is in town, so we all went to the event and I even saw 
  Shadow puppets and stuff like that. It was a lot of fun! 
  
## A couple things are up in the air for me

- I am waiting to hear back from some stuff, so that I can really plan my New Year.
  So hopefully soon. There's just a lot going on right now, but we'll see how it all
  goes.
  
## Oh, and I started the dependent types book

- Yeah, started Little Typer. I wasn't feeling so well this week, so I didn't do much
  in terms of working on the open source project, but hope to get around to starting this weekend.
  Was pretty much in bed for most of the day yesterday and today, pretty sick. I almost cancelled
  yesterday evening, but it was only for a couple hours, I pretty much took a lot of antibiotics
  and was barely okay. Slept in today. I feel a lot better after resting today, though.
  
## That's about it for me
