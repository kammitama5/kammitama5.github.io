## Simple 2D Rendering

## The Day Before LambdaConf

- Man, everyone is excited. You can *feel* the excitement on Twitter.
  We're a rowdy, eclectic bunch...functional programmers. 
  We're all excited to meet up with friends who are like family.
  
- You can tell, because people are being a bit more productive in the days
  leading up to LambdaConf. Pretty funny. A lot of contributions to Github
  in Racket, Haskell, PureScript, and Immutable JS :)
  
## I've never been to Boulder before

- There is excitement because I'm going to a new place.
  Also, I have class the night before, so I go home, do laundry,
  pack and then head to the airport tomorrow. 
  
## I may miss PureScript conf

- But we have a pretty good PureScript group where I'm located.
  So I'm not too worried, even though it would have been nice to learn a bit.
  
## I got through learning to make a simple 2D Renderer today

## Also -> Compilers

- My [Dragon book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools) showed up in the mail last night. 
  So I spent until midnight reading about Compilers and how they're made.
  My dream would be to build one in C++. That would probably take me a lifetime. 
  
## Got into

- Officially doing Advanced C++ for Fall. It's the class I should have taken before
  taking the class I'm taking now, but it's okay. My goal is just to do as much C++
  as possible. 
 
 - I may want to do Assembly after that, but it may be the same semester as the one
   in which I'd like to do an internship at JPL. So we'll see. 
   
## Things to get done 

- I have homework to do 
- Also have to contribute to the board online 

- I may be late on this one, but I'd prefer to understand it fully rather than just do it 
  just because. 
  
- I also plan to spend time in the break in-between just writing a lot of C++.
