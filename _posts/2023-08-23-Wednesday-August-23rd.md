## Maths research workshop in Banff

## I'm back
- For this week, I've been back in Banff working on some research with a group. In fact, there are
about eight groups, spread out between Bristol and our location, working together. The way it works
is that around 9am, we have a debrief on what we are working on, and our results, and we have a shared
overleaf. I can't speak for all eight groups, but that's certainly how our group has been working and
sharing our progress.
- This afternoon was our "free afternoon", so people did hikes, went downtown, etc, and the three of us
(i.e. Wissam, Victoria and myself) went to Lake Minnewanka and took a pretty pricey boat ride, which
ended up being worth it, we saw a bald eagle, and even did a 30 minute hike afterwards, too.
- One of the things that has been interesting is that I noticed only two days into working that I
was probably the only grad student in my group; most are either postdocs or faculty, which has
definitely been a little intimidating, because everyone is bright and works quickly, but they have
also been the loveliest group of people; so friendly, so helpful, and it's been a joy.
- In the mornings, we have also had talks; today Kate Stange gave a talk on sphere-packing, and
there was another one based on the general theme of our workshop.

## Here are some photos from our free afternoon.

## TODO
- I want to get up a bit early, because I'm tired, and continue to work on experiments, since
we had a short day today. I also want to finish writing up some results for another research
group I'm in that I have to check in with next week. But for now, rest.

## And that's it
