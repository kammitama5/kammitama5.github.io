## 5/11/17 - Pressing On and Great News! (Strange Loop & LambdaConf grants!)


## First up, Good News!

- It's been a dream of mine for a few years now to attend 
  both [LambdaConf](http://lambdaconf.us/) *and* [Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/). But I *never* imagined
  I'd attend *both* in the *same* year. 
  Wut? I'm so grateful, I almost started crying this morning.
  But I emailed my mom instead. 
  The tech community has been so *incredibly* supportive of me.
  I could not be more grateful. Thank you for everything,
  (whoever you are, dear reader :). It means a lot. 
  
- I've also *never* been to either Boulder or St. Louis, 
  so...yeah. I have no idea *what* to expect. These two 
  years have been the most amazing of my life, I *love* 
  programming and the tech community, and I couldn't be
  more thankful or happier. 
  
## Kata Solved:

You have -> Two players "black" and "white".
Move "black" -> Move "white" typically.
If a player wins a round, he moves again in a new round.
If a player loses a round, the other player moves next round.
Determine whose turn it is for the next round.

My solution 

```
def whoseMove(lastPlayer, win):
      if win == True:
        if lastPlayer == 'black':
          return 'black'
        else:
          return 'white'
      else:
        if lastPlayer == 'white':
          return 'black'
        else:
          return 'white'
          
```

## Other

- I started on some LaTeX, but am not happy with the result. 
  Particularly, I'm getting into fractions *and* matrices formatting.
  So I'm putting it down today and will try again tomorrow. 
  It's getting a little hairy. Good to step away and rethink.
  
  
## Things to get done 

- Quiz C++ (will be done 5/12/17 pm)
- Lab 6 (due 5/15..plan to get it done over the weekend so 5/12 to 5/15)
- Homework 7 (due 5/18..plan to get it done during the week before Wed, or else I'll hand it in 5/22 :()
- Board (due 5/22...mmm..we'll see. I can work on this remotely)

## Interesting in learning about 

- Compilers and [Tombstone Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_diagram)
- [Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether). My mentor mentioned her tonight,
  and as I was looking it up, I realized I had seen a [Google Tech Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_MpQG2xXVo) that mentioned her   contributions.
- [Affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation)
- [Orthogonal vs Orthonormal](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahmdl/LessonPlans/Lesson10.pdf) -> 
  Orthogonal has ax + b form, so there is a scalar constant, while Orthonormal has an inverse 
  without constant scalar. At least that's what I understand of it.
- [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel_symbols), which a teacher 
  at Caltech dubbed "Christ awful" symbols LOL.
- Torricelli point
  
- As you can tell...we were talking about vectors and matrices tonight, and even some tensors.
  
- I also got help with my LaTeX. My mentor said to think of using arrays instead for my notation.
  Interesting.
