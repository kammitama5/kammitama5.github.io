## A Day with Julia

## Scientific Computing
- I spent the day learning some Julia.

- This is the downloaded version. I also am running one 
  on Jupyter (see images below). So far, so good.

## I got up to Functions and reading in and plotting data
- Here are two ways of writing functions:

- one-liner

- Ruby-esque :D

## Upcoming
- Tonight, I'm probably going to work on finishing up Week 2's assignments,
  as I can run it on [JuliaBox](http://www.juliabox.org/).
  Seriously, though, these Cloud IDEs/ applications are saving my life!
- During the weekend, I'm going to work on my Data Science Project 1 project
- During the week, I'm going to finish up some Advanced SQL
- Sparklecon is next Saturday, but I'll have Sunday to work on Project 2

## I really
- Don't want to attend a boot camp or anything, because they teach a lot of web stuff.
  I'm also aware that if I join one, I'll probably be around peers who will be 
  interested in things like syntax, and not necessarily be able to interact with 
  people who are interested in other more niche aspects of programming and programming
  languages. So that's a trade-off. However, it *may* speed things up for me on 
  some levels, just in terms of focused learning.
- But if I have to, I definitely want to do one that stick with Python, because 
  at least I can have the benefit of playing around with Data Analysis on my own.
- I'm interested in correctness and languages that have succinct syntax and type-checking,
  clean code. I'd like to continue with that. I'm really tickled by the idea of just 
  settling down and doing research and working as a computer scientist. A lot of my friends
  *are* scientists, and I've found that my circle actually has a fair number of 
  mathematicians, who, when I ask them for advice, keep telling me that (even though they
  work in software) their background "isn't in CS" or that they're "Maths people, not CS people".
  I find that highly amusing. Maybe I'm attracted to a particular type of programmer?
- I'm exploring the possibility of working for a year and then using that year to build up 
  savings, while applying for my Master's. I'm honestly not that fascinated by building 
  CRUD applications, regardless of the company (Yup, that includes you; Big Fives). 
  The correctness and debugging applications and type theory are really
  fascinating, and I'd beat myself over the head if I didn't spend the time (now that I have it)
  to study some of that stuff. Some people never get to, and I have a window of opportunity (I think?).
- I've spoken to experienced developers lately, who are increasingly dissatisfied with the quality 
  of work that is being put out. Yes, a lot of people are becoming developers, and that's OK, 
  but we should still aim for maintainable code, right?
- At companies big and small, I've been hearing of devs frustrated because people just
  *don't care*. They get paid enough, so why does it matter if the tower falls?
  So I have a sense of what I'm stepping into, and I'm aware of an environment where
  I will probably be looked down upon because I don't have the experience, *plus* being told that
  things like correctness *don't matter* because it's all about shipping a project. So that's something
  to think about. 

## That's pretty much it for now.
