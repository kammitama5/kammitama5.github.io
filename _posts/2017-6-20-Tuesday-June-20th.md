## A pop up I made a while ago (Edgar Allen Poe)

## What's this!?

- I actually made this in an engineering class years ago.
  My professor liked it so much, he wanted it, so I let him have it.
  
- It's a laser-cut pop-up based on a short story by Edgar Allen Poe.
  In it, he describes being caught in the midst of a storm.
 
- I really liked it, because his work is a bit dark, and I guess
  at the time there was a lot of uncertainty in my life.

## Why are you including this? This isn't code!

- Lots of **great** engineers draw from different things.
  I have a strange background, and often see things in different ways,
  so I just wanted to share a bit of myself. 
  One of my friends jokes that I "misinterpret everything". 
  
  You don't have to be one thing, and I think that being a well-rounded
  engineer means that you draw from different life experiences. 
  Btw, NASA actually *does* hire origami artists to help them engineer
  how they fit things into spacecraft. So yes, it's actually a form 
  of engineering/ thinking that's useful. 
  
- I spend a lot of time reading, and especially on the Internet.
  I'm drawn towards mathematics, good design, programming, and the hacker/maker culture.
  
## So..will you stop talking and just post some pics?

Sure thing!

## If you'd like to read more about my path
- Please head on over to [this post](https://kammitama5.github.io/Sunday-May-3rd/). There are more CAD drawings there, too! :) (at one point, I thought I wanted to be an architect or Art Director, so I took a bunch of hand drafting and CAD classes, as well as machining, welding, and made models, and got into programming through parametric modelling, which is very mathematical, through programmes such as Modo and Rhino.
