## LambdaConf Day 2: Late but Fun Day

## I learned a bit of Coq today

- It's actually pretty fun. Great for Theorem proving

## And then we ended up of course, talking about Haskell!

## Conclusion

- David, who taught the Category Theory session,
  asked for my notes in LaTeX today. It was so nice 
  of him. He also reached out to me and told me to 
  contact him if I ever needed any help or anything 
  like that, which was *so* nice of him!
  Amazing!
  He's had my favourite talk so far, along with the 
  Coq and Mighty Morphism one.
