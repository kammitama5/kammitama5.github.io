## GSoC Day 74

## Another day
 - I decided to stay in today, as I went to sleep around 2am and had some personal stuff to take care
   of with my landlord because of my neighbour's friend's mess (see previous post about flooding). 
   So I decided to spend the day coding
   and I had an *awesome* day. I just enjoy coding all day long. It's made me think about some things
   I hadn't thought about before, so I may just have to work on those for the rest of the year. 
   
 - I had to modify a pull request I've been working on for the last few days;
   that was an experience because it's in a language I'm learning that's
   very similar in many ways to Haskell, so it was funny, and I enjoyed doing it, while working remotely
   with a mentor halfway across the world. Eventually, it all worked and all the doc tests passed. Whew!
   
## Then, Haskell

 - I sat down in a cafe and just did Haskell all day. I worked through Hbook, chapter 11. Right now, I'm
   doing laundry as I have to pack for three days of sitting in someone's home playing with their 120 lb 
   German Shepherd (who has made an appearance on this blog :)) I really just plan on working on my final
   write-up and retrospect for GSoC, which my mentors spoke about with me (it's to be submitted between the
   6th and the 13th, but they advised me to start a draft asap.) We also plan on coding up to the end of
   GSoC, because it's fun :)
   
## FastForward and StartOver button

 - Today Chris made me laugh because he apparently uses a text editor he wrote many years ago for editing
   his code. I think that's really awesome, because everyone has tried to convince me that I need to choose
   either Vim or Emacs. I used mostly Sublime this summer, but will try to learn Vim. However, I'd *love* 
   to build my own editor, probably in Haskell (and I probably will!). I really think that's so awesome!!
   
 - Today, we worked on the StartOver aka Restart button..but we already have a Restart button that does
   something else, so.. :)

 - And also, the fast-forward button

 - One thing it does is tie to the range on the ```SpeedSlider```, so we had to ensure that the values
   were fenced to reflect that with respect to the range of the fast forward button. 
   
## So that's..pretty much it
