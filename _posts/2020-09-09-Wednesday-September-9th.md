## Writing Group (9/9/2020)

## Writing
- Today's writing group was more stream of consciousness. It was a challenging subject for me, to be honest.
- I'm also a bit tired, as I had a lot going on this week (still do). I also had my first live writing consult today!
- I have to stay up late to write code. Wish me compiles! Weird how my life is between writing papers and writing code now. Pretty much a lot 
  of writing. However, I am doing this class tonight that will be letting me draw some stuff, so that should be kind of cool. I thought of getting
  a replacement for my Wacom that I had to get rid of when I moved. I kind of miss it (I had three Wacoms, tbh). I also have been in a LOT of meetings. Ugh. Meetings. 

## Prompt
- I won't put the entire prompt down, but it was about writing as a toy and a portal. There was another prompt about 
  how writing is more about the interaction than about the writing itself, which was interesting, as well.


## One
-The interaction of writing as being central to the act of writing is difficult for me to think about. 
Writing in itself is like sewing up deep wounds with sutures. Writing is memory.
Writing is the reliving of trauma for some. 
Collective writing for me is the cementing of a particular ideology from a single idea. Writing can become dogmatic truth. 

## Two
- When we use the word “collective”, whose collective does this represent? 
I think about the writing of constitutions, of laws, of spiritual books. 
I think about bills being passed, and codes of conduct. 
In my field of Artificial Intelligence, I think about the writing of history, the writing out of some of our histories. 
I think of Lynn Conway. Her disappearance. Her writing about that disappearance.

## Three
- The language of play is allegory. It is play of words that can be sounds, that can be musical and whimsical. 
Engineers love puns. Perhaps it is their portal for play in a world of structure and so-called objectivity. 
It is their place to play.

## Four
- Writing as play is a shadow-language. It allows one to live one’s authentic self in a world where that is not possible. 
I think of pen names and code switching and writing free from mere utility.
I get paid to write now. Will I hate it? Will the play disappear?

## Five
- Writing is a portal of ideas and of nightmares.
I think of great writers in my own country, who used the writing of extempo and sobriquets to be someone else; 
to have an alternate existence in the world within which they existed, where they could be exalted. 
Their writing made them griots in their communities.
I think of Lord Kitchener, who in spite of this portal, died tragically. An immense loss. 
I think of his music and writing that continues to live on.

## Six
- I think of my own struggle to write. 

## Seven
- I think that writing is not a portal to joy, but one of communicating immense loss. 
I don’t think it is a toy because great writing outlives its authors. 
Great writing outlives commodification; we cannot contain it, describe it, but we can feel it. 
But as a toy, society falls in and out of love with writings, 
as the tide turns and we begin to see wisdom in the writings we neglected because they were not fashionable. 
H.G. Wells is hip again.

## Eight
- During my teenage years, I wrote my dad several letters, and I would mail them to him. 
He lived in Montserrat at the time.
I would look forward to those blue letters, that were hand-written, 
in which he would explain in words how he saw the world. He was one of my penpals, 
and that was my portal to see the world outside of the island on which I lived. 
It takes a certain amount of commitment to be a penpal, to commit yourself to that portal. 
It is very different from the writing of today, which seems to be sped up by technology. 
No one wants to commit to reading. It is like those troll dolls from the 80s. 
Why should one invest in a toy that has outlived its usefulness anyway? 
Who needs silence and a pen and paper? What are you, a luddite?

## That's it
