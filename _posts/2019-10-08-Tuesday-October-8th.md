## Taking time to acknowledge everything

## I just completed a Meeting
- I've been poking around the Internet to see what PhD profiles can and do look like. 
  It occurred to me after a one and a half hour long weekend that I haven't taken the time to acknowledge 
  some of the stuff I've done this year.
  
- PhDs do that, I guess, so maybe I should too?
- If you find this confusing, please check out my most up to date CV in the Other section of the [About](https://kammitama5.github.io/about/) page.
  I tend to list things as I hear about things here, so they're not necessarily ordered in terms of the months I have to perform such tasks (sorry!).

## I think this means I'm not doing *too* badly in my first semester

- I keep pushing myself, though. It's been fun. I've really been enjoying research, my classes, and being a PhD student.
  I can't imagine really doing anything else right now. 
  
- There are many; so many more things in the works right now, but I should get to sleep. But I feel a bit better; it's been
  a wild ride!
- I tend to look ahead and think of all the things I *want* to accomplish, which can distract from the things I have accomplished. What a list!
  
## And that's about it
