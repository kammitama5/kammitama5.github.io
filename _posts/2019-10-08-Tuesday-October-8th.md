## Taking time to acknowledge everything

## I just completed a Meeting
- I've been poking around the Internet to see what PhD profiles can and do look like. 
  It occurred to me after a one and a half hour long weekend that I haven't taken the time to acknowledge 
  some of the stuff I've done this year.
  
- PhDs do that, I guess, so maybe I should too?
  
## Lately

- Basically started by wrapping up last year by finishing up a local internship in El Segundo [Jan]
- I attended a workshop at MSRI on Derived Algebraic Geometry [Feb]
- Internship at Apple, which ended May 31st [Feb to May]
- I attended a Number Theory Conference at Cornell [April]
- Internship at another company (Mercury) on June 3rd, which ended August 9th [ June to Aug]
- I attended a conference at the Simons Institute in Berkeley on Error Correcting Codes and Encryption [ June ]
- I attended Racket School, a PL workshop where we build a language from the ground up in a week [ July ]
- I attended Curry On, a PL conference in London [ July ]
- Flew back to LA and packed everything in a week, and started school the following Monday [ Aug ]
- Somewhere in there, I was accepted for a Research Proposal group through NASA that meets weekly. 
  That's been my Tuesday evenings, even though we are also on Whatsapp and communicate pretty
  frequently for scheduling meetings, etc [ July to present ]
- I started attending meetings on Wednesdays for my school's research project [ Sept to present ] 
- I started TA-ing the Matlab class, with office hours and TA hours pretty much on Thursdays. It's been a mix
  of showing up to two classes back to back, holding 2 hours of office hours and grading assignments. [ Sept to present ]
- I gave a talk in my first week of attending classes for our CS Research Day, which included the faculty from
  our department and the Department Chair (how about that for your first week!) [ September ] 
- I gave another talk a week and a half later to our local CS Club on Google Summer of Code and Internships [ September ]
- I am giving another (shorter) talk this Wednesday for our CS Club on Open Source projects involving Mathematics [ October ]
- I am attending the Google Developer Student Lead Summit in Sunnyvale (all expenses paid by Google) [ October ]
- I am giving another talk to a senior class on Interviewing, Job-hunting, Finances (basically life advice) [ October ] 
- I received a travel grant through the NSF to attend Sage Days, which is about contributing to SageMath,
  open source software for Computational Maths. [ November ]
  
## I think this means I'm not doing *too* badly in my first semester

- I keep pushing myself, though. It's been fun. I've really been enjoying research, my classes, and being a PhD student.
  I can't imagine really doing anything else right now. I haven't decided quite yet if I am going to do a summer internship
  next year, but I've been applying and interviewing, so we'll see how it all turns out. Either way, I can just stay over
  the summer and do research, too, so it depends. 
  
## And that's about it
