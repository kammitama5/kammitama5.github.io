## Taking time to acknowledge everything

## I just completed a Meeting
- I've been poking around the Internet to see what PhD profiles can and do look like. 
  It occurred to me after a one and a half hour long weekend that I haven't taken the time to acknowledge 
  some of the stuff I've done this year.
  
- PhDs do that, I guess, so maybe I should too?
- If you find this confusing, please check out my most up to date CV in the Other section of the [About](https://kammitama5.github.io/about/) page.
  I tend to list things as I hear about things here, so they're not necessarily ordered in terms of the months I have to perform such tasks (sorry!).

  our department and the Department Chair (how about that for your first week!) [ Sept ] 
- I gave another talk a week and a half later to our local CS Club on Google Summer of Code and Internships [ Sept ]
- I gave another (shorter) talk this Wednesday for our CS Club on Open Source projects involving Mathematics [ Oct ]
- I attended the Google Developer Student Lead Summit in Sunnyvale (all expenses paid by Google) [ Oct ]
- I gave another talk to a senior class on Interviewing, Job-hunting, Finances (basically life advice) [ Oct ] 
- I received a Udacity Technology Scholarship powered by Bertelsmann for their AI track, specifically the "Intro to Deep Learning with Pytorch" course. Will probably do this over the winter break [ Nov ]
- I received an Opportunity to attend both Twitter's MLFlock events for PhD ML students in Boston and New York; 
  I attended the [event in New York City](https://mlflocktalkny2019.splashthat.com/) on Academia to Industry and Twitter technology [ Nov ]
- I accepted an internship via Code2040 to work at Autodesk's Pier 9 for Summer 2020. I'm super excited. There are robots and there is data there, and my team is amazing! [ Nov ] 
- I was interviewed by an organization called Career Girls (Boston) at MIT for support of women in STEM [ Nov ]
- I received a travel grant through the NSF to attend Sage Days, which is about contributing to SageMath,
  open source software for Computational Maths [ Nov ]
- I received a WiCyS Student Scholarship! I will be attending the 2020 WiCyS Conference (lodging and registration provided) [ Nov ]
- I received a full reimbursement opportunity to attend the GRA-WP Cohort for Women in 2020 [ Nov ]
- I received a full reimbursement opportunity to attend the GRA-WP Cohort for Underrepresented Minorities in 2020 [ Nov ]
- I received complimentary registration and a travel grant to attend Neurips! I currently have tickets also for the Black in AI workshops, as well as the WiML workshops [ Dec ]
- I received a fee waiver for registration and a travel/lodging grant to attend Real World Crypto 2020, via the IACR.
  The conference will be in New York City, and I am funded for this opportunity by a generous NSF grant [ Dec ]
- I received word that I am an NCWIT Finalist! [ Dec ]
- I applied (and received an offer from) the Graduate Writing Centre; I will be learning how to write and mentoring students
  for around six hours a week in an interdisciplinary writing skillset at the graduate level (so reviewing and helping graduate students write papers in Literature, Materials Science, History, etc)! [ December ]

## I think this means I'm not doing *too* badly

- I keep pushing myself, though. It's been fun. I've really been enjoying research, my classes, and being a PhD student.
  I can't imagine really doing anything else right now. 
  
- There are many; so many more things in the works right now, but I should get to sleep. But I feel a bit better; it's been
  a wild ride!
- I tend to look ahead and think of all the things I *want* to accomplish, which can distract from the things I have accomplished. What a list!
  
## And that's about it
