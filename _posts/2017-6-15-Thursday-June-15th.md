- I got some *great* advice from the people on functional Slack.
  C++ is such a great language, and it's challenging,

- I also got a list of good resources :

[Stack Overflow C++ Book Guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list)

- Good Youtube C++ tutorial stuff
