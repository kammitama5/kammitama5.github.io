## Official Start of GSoC

## It's just after midnight (Sun/Monday AM)
- I'm building my project for GSoC. I really like these hours; I took a nap in the afternoon, after watching 
  puffnfresh's stream: he got the flowers to work and collision to work, even though there is a bug when 
  Sonic is moving downwards, in that he seems to move up and then down. However, so far, so good.
  We were also ported to a Haskell station today, where the streamer immediately said "nooo! Don't raid me!".
  Pretty funny. He was working on some Codewars challenges (one particular one involving wallpaper) at the time.
  
## In a few hours
- I have a welcome call with the mentors and organizers of Rust Reach. 5am, to be precise. I have to definitely set my 
  alarm to be up for that! I'm excited, though. Should be fun!
- I also have to go to an office for an afternoon interview, and unfortunately, with traffic, that means I'll have to miss class today.
  My professor was nice enough (at midnight) to tell me the files I need to look at to be able to do the assignment.
  And I'll have part of Wednesday if I have any questions or am stuck. The particular assignment is in Ada.
- After that, I have a GSoC meeting with my mentor (the other mentor is unable to make this particular meeting), 
  and right after that, I have another meeting with a different group for Rust. So quite a busy day!
- It looks like I should be able to make my meetings, though. So I should be OK. 
  
## However
- I'm pretty happy to say that I have a lot of time to dedicate to GSoC and Rust. So after Monday, I'm pretty much
  just working on my projects.
