## Hi!
- I'm in SoCal, full after having eaten churros and celebrating Taco Tuesdays. It feels weird to be back, and to hear people
say that "this is a place everyone wants to be", having left that place, after having lived there for many years
(I do "get it" though; as a coworker said years ago, "California is 'easy living'" comparable to other states).
If you are from say, NYC or the Bay, the pace is a lot different, though, and that can be a bit annoying sometimes (lol).
You have to just enjoy the pace, and realize that well, messed up stuff that causes traffic or random things happens, too.
If you live here, you accept these things. Like idk, a random actor shooting (no; with a gun, not a movie)
at cars on Sunset boulevard, or choppers going
after a rogue officer from the military who wrote a manifesto talking about corruption, or idk, a tank on Hollywood Boulevard
(all things I experienced having lived there).
- It's also strange to be back; the sketchy part of Pasadena is now gentrified, and some of the people
I knew even retired from the biz,
hotels have influencer rates (??), and it all made me grateful that I experienced LA at the time that I did. I don't think
I could do that in its current state, with its current cost of living and economy; it was a very different place back
in the day that made it easier for people who were just working-class / starting out and didn't have a lot of cash to enjoy
the city; it's much more difficult to do that now. Some of my friends have houses, and it's just different, now, I guess.
- I have to admit, when I've been to these conferences in say, Cali, you don't really get to experience the city in the
same way as when you have to live there. For example, I used to take the bus everywhere in SoCal. I keep having these
weird flashbacks and memories in passing certain spots around town; it's very strange. Like today, when I saw an ad
for Cinco de Mayo, and it immediately made me remember that when I first moved to LA, my friend took me to a bar where
a couple people from the show "Bones" were celebrating "Cinco de Drinko" (as they called it; I think because
she had done some day-playing on the show), and we ended up with some
seven foot tall crew member sleeping in the back seat of her car, wearing a giant sombrero, until we got to his place
because he was definitely not able to drive home in his current state. It seems weird to remember those things now lol.
- Or someone mentioned having "outdoor showers" and they laughed when I said that having lived here, I would never think
of that, because when I lived here there were lots of "Good Morning news" type things saying that bears would sneak onto
people's properties and bathe in their pools, so an outdoor shower just means you want bears to find it and shower in your
yard. Also, someone brought up coyotes tonight, and I had to tell the story of my friend and myself working until the
early mornings on a film shoot in Malibu, and my clinging to her for dear life as she held out an app in front of her
that she said supposedly made sounds only coyotes would hear and wouldn't like. Those are the memories I have of LA;
I really don't have much of clubbing or doing drugs or doing coke or getting drunk to the point of messing up my career..
or any of those weird things apparently everyone else seems to have
done besides myself (like shouting "Woo!" really loudly with the top down of a convertible; I did drive with the top down
in a convertible in LA, but I got sick the next day from the cold air, so that doesn't count, and I certainly did not
scream "Woo!" while I was in it) lol.
- I think most of the time I was just busy working really hard, trying to stay in the country,
reading a tonne of books and just making my way through that world, with the kindness of strangers along the way.
And so, every time I come back, there are a gazillion people who want to meet and catch up. My first day was spent just
scheduling everyone in, trying to play schedule-tetris. And trying to figure out who is in town, or working, etc.
- I went to one of the cafés we used to go to and it was overcrowded and the quality was pretty terrible, which was
disappointing; it used to be a staple of hanging out with friends. I guess..oh well. Things change. There are still
tents all over downtown, so maybe things don't always change.

## Anyways
- So the work has been awesome thus far! Today I got to hang out with my friend, who used to work at NASA (for 50+ years).
- Since my workshop is on Caltech's campus, and he went there for undergrad (Physics), it was wild to see his mind run
through the memories as we were able to see the Physics building for the first time for him since probably the sixties.
- He had joined one year after Feynman apparently left. But he recalled the classes he had and where, and which class
was absolutely useless because it was essentially a grad student teaching their research (lol), and about another professor
who interviewed him at his house before deciding that yes, he was good enough mathematically to take his class (apparently,
that was a thing!). Interestingly, he wanted to study Computational Mathematics for his PhD at either Caltech or USC,
but at the time, the Maths department said "that sounds like something you should talk to the computer science department
about" and the CS department said "that sounds like a Maths thing". No such field really existed back then. So that was
really interesting, because there's literally a Computational Mathematics building on Caltech's campus, now.
- I seem to have a lot of friends like that, to be honest, or maybe I just draw in people like that into my life. They're
always "early" in terms of how they think, their perspectives, and often it can be quite painful and unfair when people
just don't get why you think something is important / necessary. If I had a dollar for every time I had a story like that...

## Photos
- Here are some photos from this week! We have lectures in the morning, and then we have discussions and work through
research problems in the afternoon. Then there is happy hour, and today we had a banquet.
- It's been a lot of fun; my people are generally out on this coast. But I'll be here for summer, anyways, so I'm looking
forward to it. I have to say, this is the closest to a mix of people in Maths (pqc, Number Theory, Combinatorics), CS quantum
algos and complexity theory and quantum computing I've seen in one space. It's mostly academics, but a smattering
of industry people (like say, Google Quantum or whatever), but not in an obnoxious "hey, we basically sponsored
your conference so hear us blab about how great our work is" kind of way. Everyone is super nice, collaborative,
chill and a lot of fun, with a pretty good sense of humour. There is a curiosity about our gaps in knowledge,
and a willingness to share knowledge. It's been really great.

- omg churros. Yes.

- the people are so nice here, I had just mentioned I'd love a piña colada and they got me one and I didn't even notice
until I was sitting at the table. Awww. I miss nice people!

- Taco Tuesdays...I know; no tacos lol. These are soft tacos so I think they count?

- I kind of flipped out when I saw this. They also have the asymmetric tiling so you can spend hours of your life working
on building them.

- This was in the Physics building and I freaked out. So awesome!

- Feynman. My mentor / friend from years ago took classes in this very building, but took the class a year after Feynman left.
I mean, he did get to work on the Voyager mission, go to parties after launches at JPL, hang out with Carl Sagan, and all sorts
of cool stuff, so I think this was not as big of a miss for him.

- This was fun to see in the classroom. I also saw an old-style slide projector. In undergrad, my job was actually to scan
slides for the library for professors' classes and crop them in Photoshop or something like that. I learned a bit of scripting,
too, to rename all the files in one go. Some of the other students, like a girl I knew from Bulgaria, used to work the
film projector (that was work-study back in the day).

- From our workshop, talking about RAAG (Artin Groups)

- Vegan fish tacos. I got to have lunch with, and meet Nadia, who is a cryptographer I have thought is super awesome, for years.
I was surprised that she looks a lot like her photo online (lol). She is also just really, very nice and super humble!

- a book my friend (who came all the way from Zurich; I met him at Eurocrypt last year, in Lyon!) and I found on the first day!

- the morning after I arrived, I had problems sleeping (I went to sleep early the evening before and got up at 2am), and realized
Poirot was showing at 3am! My parents (especially my mom) love Poirot, so I had to text her.

- Flying to Cali. I had the entire row to myself. I watched two Hunger Games movies back to back, and part of Oppenheimer,
while lying down with headphones on. Pretty rad.

## And that's it!
