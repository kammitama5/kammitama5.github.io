## Data and Retrospective

## Hey everyone! 

- As this year comes to a close, I'd like to do a little retrospective.

## But first....I've been learning Pandas!

- It's been *really* enjoyable! 
- They even use stuff like tail, which is used in FP. 

## Reading in files and filling in missing data (my solutions)

## Checking for duplicate data and placing the mean value instead

- verify by checking duplicates before and after

## Using a Scatterplot to explore relationships between two values/ columns

## Looking at the data and its shape/ description

## Getting the last row of the data

## Getting the last three rows of data

- A lot of this feels like dealing with a database, which is really fun!

## Next up, we're going to be doing some case studies...

- And then I have a few projects to complete. 
  I'm doing a mini-course on just Python Analysis, and also doing
  the Nanodegree. 
- I'm really enjoying both.
- It reminds me of Databases, R, Functional programming, 
  LaTeX, Matlab, Mathematica, all in one *humble bundle* (see what I did there :D)
  
## And now..a Retrospective

- I've been musing about this for a few days...
