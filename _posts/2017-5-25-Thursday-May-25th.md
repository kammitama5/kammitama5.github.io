- Officially made it and went to my first day. It was awesome.
  There was so much to choose from.

## I chose Category Theory (all day Session)

- This was with David Spivak, who is a researcher at MIT.
  He was fantastic. I'm new to a lot of this, and I was
  definitely stretched mentally, but I also learned a lot.
  
## I wrote notes in LaTeX.

- I'll try to align the notes as best I can with images he drew
