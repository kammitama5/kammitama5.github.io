## 4/20/17 - Dijkstra


## Personal: 


"For after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till that moment
there was not much of a programming discipline, but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay, 
that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in
the years to come? " - Edsger W. Dijkstra


- So one of the reasons I'm taking this logic course is because of this group I joined about two years ago
  called ["Papers We Love"](https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-LA/?scroll=true).
  I had barely started programming, but it was important to me to learn from
  the greats in the field. I'm not sure why, but I thought that it would be a good opportunity to learn
  about and sit on the shoulders of giants. I was not disappointed.
  
- Coming back full-circle, I have have had to read and to try to understand what exactly Dijkstra was getting at,
  why what he did for the field of Computer Science was so important.
