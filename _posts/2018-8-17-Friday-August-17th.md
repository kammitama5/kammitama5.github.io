## My first RustConf!

## What a day!
- I'm *exhausted*. The funny thing is, I'm getting up tomorrow to go the Farmer's Market and a Hack day!
  I had a *lot* of fun today! I can't even explain it all, but I met so many people, and I even made it
  into two talks! (including the keynote!). I just had a great time at this conference!
  
## Here are some photos!

- Using Rust for space craft. Kubos made a product
  called kubOS that uses Rust. Spoke about challenges
  of using it and the space industry.

- Rust in Tor

- Interesting because they were working on codebase
  which was written in both Rust and C, and spoke about
  having (or wanting) global allocation properties
  between the two bases.

- Chris Wong's talk on Macros. I realized afterwards
  he was part of our group that stayed up until 10:45pm
  last night in the bar for the Facebook party. He is
  ```lfairy``` on github

- His talk was interesting because he spoke about
  how the compiler interprets things like spans.

- Job board

- Among our group was a Nick, who works at Mozilla
  Research, and Nick's wife, Jeena, and a researcher
  who is doing his PhD candidacy at a school with an
  advisor I am seriously considering. So it was lovely
  to ask him questions and get more information about
  his application process and his current experience.
  He seems to be enjoying it very much.
  
 - Finally..back to my swanky room..I decided 
   to do the fake hot-tub thing and had the most
   glorious bath-tub experience!

- Best Rust Conf ever! (well, first Rust Conf ever, too!)

## That's it!
