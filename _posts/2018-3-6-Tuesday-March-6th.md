## It's my Birthday! 

## Happy Happy Birthday....to me!
- Did you really just make an entire post for your birthday? 

## YUP! :D

## Today was wonderful!

- Lots of Happy Birthday wishes all the way from New Zealand and Tokyo to a cake right here in California :D

## The parents
- They win :D 

- They sent me a puzzle and even gave me a clue :D

- This is what it translated to read

- My parents are so cool! 

## In other news...

- I spent most of my day researching grad schools and doing Haskell. 
  I'm currently on Chapter 4, on page 107. So far, so good. 

## Research
- My friend is applying to a bunch of schools locally, so that he can get in
  for Fall of this year. This would be at the tail end of applications. 
  
- I spoke to my parents about it, and they told me to just do what I was doing,
  take my time and research a programme I want, and apply to those. Taking 
  a bit more time and applying later in the year (for next year) also gives me
  time to build up some savings. So that's not too bad, either. Plus, it gives me
  time to do some more coursework and take some more classes and do more 
  research. Anything that gives me a stronger application and makes me more prepared
  is worth it for me.
  
- A friend of mine who is a scientist and well-known FP-er and has a PhD offered 
  to Skype with me later this week. I really appreciate his taking the time to help 
  me. It means a lot. People in the research community and especially in PL really
  seem to be good people. Another person earlier last week even said over a summer 
  once I get in a programme, I can help work on a language's (that I like) compiler system.
  I'd really like to do that. I'd like to work in a lab for experience. All of that stuff
  would be great. 

## MO
- What's my desire for all of this? POPL was the first time things really came together for me. 
  I've been in and out of languages and trying to do things like web-dev because it's what I was 
  told I had to do to get my foot in the door in industry, and then data science because I have 
  the capacity for it and like stats and patterns with numbers. However, PL (Programming Languages,
  Compiler Theory, Type Theory, FP) is that thing that lights me on fire. It's the thing I keep
  coming back to. My mentor for my data science course asked me what I planned to accomplish one
  week and I told him I was learning Julia because I really liked the type system. He likes chatting
  with me, but I'm *that* student. What is she up to? 
- This past Monday, my prof was talking about languges like C and PHP, and I asked him "have you tried
  Rust?" This ended up in his stopping the class to look up Rust. Then he went "hmm..." Hahaha. I also
  mentioned to him about the new Firefox and the Rust server, because well..it's interesting. 
  
## Good news
- I'm paying 1/5 of what I was paying for classes. That means I can now take more :D I also applied 
  for a scholarship. I don't expect anything, but we'll see, I guess. It took me two trips up to 
  the office of admissions, the last of which I forgot I had my Denotational Semantics text in my bag.
  The trip uphill was *not* fun. That's a big book!
  
## Future goals
- I plan to continue working through Haskellbook
- I plan to continue reading Denotational Semantics and Mathematical Logic
- I plan to learn Proofs and finish up the paper I'm reading for that guy for the book
- Around Fall, I plan to learn Liquid Haskell
- I plan to continue in any way I can, either by making a compiler or an interpreter or something. 
- I'd also like to do some research..somewhere. There are a few possibilities. In any case, I seem
  to mostly get recruited for that sort of work. So I don't think it will be *too* much of a problem. 
  I still have time to apply for some research stuff at labs in my area or JPL. We'll see.
  
## And, that's about it.
