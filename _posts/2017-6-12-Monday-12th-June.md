## Exam tomorrow

- I totally have an Exam tomorrow,
  but playing with Firebase is more fun!
  
## Codelabs has some neat stuff

- Playing around with their tutorial stuff.
  Here is this App thing they start you off with 
  to learn to use Firebase and their AI.api.
  
- There are a couple things...it isn't really
  conducive to using a Cloud-based service
  (which I like doing because my current laptops
  have little to no storage, and it's good to 
  just delete virtual environments and start afresh
  sometimes
  
- And..not very intuitive sometimes...
  Everything looks like text, so it isn't always obvious
  *where* you shoud enter fields
  (ie where you *can* input text or values, vs where you can't)
  Still very fun, though.
