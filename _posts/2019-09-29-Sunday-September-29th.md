## It's just a PhD...and other thoughts

## I'm at my school's library
- I'm taking a mini-break while working on an assignment that is a mix of 3D motion detection and neural networks. 
  It's generally the assignment that takes up my Sunday and Monday; the rest of the week is taken up with classes,
  my other assignments for my two classes, and TA-ing.
  
- I've joined a Slack outside of school that is functional-programming based (my friend at my Spring internship introduced
  me to the space) and it's a great group of people. Every week, a bot reminds us "what did you learn/ build this week?".
  It has really been a great activity for me to post there once a week what I've accomplished. 
  Someone on the Slack joked that I was "making them all look bad" by the sheer number of tasks
  I had accomplished, but I'm also in grad school, so I just laughed about it. My school also has a weekly
  Wednesday scrum, but that is usually more a research-driven scrum than one for general accomplishments.
  
- I gave a talk this week on open source and my (very limited) experience, for students at my school, in the hope that
  one of them might find motivation in contributing to a project. I'm thinking that at some point, I'd like to organize
  a thing whereby we can all commit to open source of some sort, so that it's something the students have experience
  doing, or can at least say they did. 
  
## It takes a while for me to realize where I am
- I did a bit of hiking yesterday with a group, and found myself chatting with two really nice graduate students;
  one was in an Accelerated Master's in History, and the other was in Physical Sciences. I was recounting a story
  of generosity and kindness from my advisors and one of the students remarked "wow; you must be really good at 
  what you do!". That startled me a bit, because I certainly don't feel that way (especially after my stint in 
  Silicon Valley, where talent is everywhere). Another person in our group heard that I was a computer science major
  and remarked "wow; you guys are geniuses. You can build *anything*". I was pretty silent after that, and said that
  I didn't feel that way, because coming from the West Coast, where flames are thrown daily at people who are in that
  field because of the *negative* impact we've had on communities and for our arrogance and self-righteousness,
  those compliments don't feel right. 
  
- Another student, while I was giving my talk earlier this week, remarked "You were in California? Why are you here, then?"
  It occurred to me that I was, in fact, not in California anymore, but having lived there for so long, my mind assumed
  that everyone in the room knew that the photo I had shown was indeed from San Francisco. And oh, that question of
  "why are you here?". That has plagued me for most of my life, because I've never completely fit *anywhere*.
  
## But why am I here?
- There is a lot I think I can mentally find in this space. It's grounded, small enough for me to exist, and is full of
  creative and interesting people who are authentic. Many of their values line up with mine, even though, in many respects
  the people here are quite different from myself. 
  
- One thing to note is also that the work is challenging (at least for me), but I keep pushing myself, because the harder
  it gets, the more I realize I *want* to be here. Until I am thrown out, I am going to keep pursuing a PhD. 
  I haven't felt more engaged by the work, and more intellectually stimulated in a way that is also *my job* in a long while.
  And unfortunately, most of what the workforce in tech is providing is not particularly interesting to me at the moment.
  There are *some* places, but they pretty much require me to continue my path. 
  
- So I want to make the most of my time here, and I keep pushing myself, but I don't know if I'm doing the *right* thing
  by doing this, because I could have an easier PhD life. But it's difficult for me, knowing all the things I've been through
  to get here. I want to make the most of my time here. My advisors have reassured me that what I am doing *is* the right thing,
  but I am too immature mentally to really *understand* if it is. I guess only time will tell. 
  
## Here are photos from our Hike

- A few photos, including a tour of the Ben and Jerry's factory!
