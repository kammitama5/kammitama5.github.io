## It's here!

## GUIs
- I'm taking a class for fun on GUIs and how we could re-imagine them if they were influenced by periods in art history.
- I jumped at taking the course because it's the perfect blend of what I like; tech and creativity.
- It's also an excuse to get a Wacom, which I really wanted to get since I had to give the ones I had away when I moved :(

## I took a nap
- I took a nap and got up and saw something at my door this afternoon..it was my Wacom!
- I haven't been sketching since last summer, and I haven't done any digital painting since around 2016-2017-ish?
- So maybe in between all the other stuff I'm doing, during quarantine, I'll find time to paint or do some digital sketching. 
- It's a nice thing to do while listening to podcasts or if you just want to clear your head from work.
