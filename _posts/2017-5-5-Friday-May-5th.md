## 5/5/17 - A new angle

## TIL

- Quite a few things, actually.
  I decided to try a C++ Pong tutorial.
 369 lines of code later, I learned a *lot*.

## Things I had to deal with that I didn't have to in the JS version

## Pointers

## Enums

- Charmap (didn't know about this one). Quite neat to make paddle.
  Shortcut on Windows -> Windows + R. Find hex code to insert.
  
## Pathway

## First we tested that the ball function worked

## Then we tested that the paddle function worked

##  Then we tested placement and that the cout has our positions for paddle and ball initial values

## This is where we inserted using Charmap, to get better images for the paddle and walls

## Then we tested and tested and amended the game

## Finally, we added and tested the score function. Game on!

# Overall commentary

- I really liked the methodical way of this tutorial compared to the JS one.
  The JS one had code all over the place, out of order, without explanation.
  
- This one was more systematic and logical, and was careful to build bit by bit,
  explaining what and why and the logic. 
  
- Also, tests...tests were great to double-check and really see if you had an understanding.
