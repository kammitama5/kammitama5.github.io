## A day of Programming Languages and Dinner!

## Just across the street from the Quantum Conference
- So just across the street from the quantum conference, I chose to volunteer for a programming languages
charity event with the inventors of the Python, Typescript, and Java Programming languages. The inventor of
Smalltalk was also supposed to be there, but they ended up not making it. The panel was on their thoughts
on the future of programming languages.
- With some serendipity, they mentioned that if they were working on a PhD right now in Programming Languages,
rather than just the usual things PL students tend to focus on, they would work on a language for things that
act like computers, and one continued, "like a GPU or a Quantum Computer". I smiled and began doing a happy
dance. Some of the other volunteers connected with me afterwards, because I had made it clear that I was
really here for a Quantum conference upon meeting them, and when that was mentioned, their interest was piqued.
So great stuff!
- Coincidentally, tomorrow I had planned to attend a workshop on a DSL for Quantum since last week, too. So
great timing!

## Afterwards
- I rejoined some of my Quantum friends from the conference I actually came here to attend to have dinner.
- We went to a Taiwanese restaurant. The food was good, and affordable! We have planned more activities
in the evening tomorrow, too! I'm pretty excited.
- As I was walking back to my hotel, I kept thinking that these are so my people, and I'm having such a great time!
