## GSoC Day 63

## I finally got around

 - Today was my first experience running tests using QuickTest on this computer.
   I believe I used it a bit last year using GHCI on another computer. I installed it on 
   ```ghci``` by using ```sudo apt-get install libghc-quickcheck2-dev```. Then, I loaded
   ```ghci``` and ran a function I had written that had imported ```Test.QuickCheck```.
 - I wrote a few functions to test different ones that could fail vs other ones that would pass
   the generated tests. Pretty neat stuff.
 - This is also a [neat article on testing](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/01/quickcheck), too, using QuickCheck.
   
 ## I also worked through
  - Applicatives and Functors in the [CIS194](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall16/index.html) chapters. I haven't gotten around to any of that in
    the HBook, so we'll see how that goes once I get to it. But so far, so good.
    
 ## Writing things down
  - I got my AC plug for my laptop (that had died), so that's up and running, and got a notebook,
    where I've been writing everything haskell-related down. So we'll see how it goes. I burn through
    notebooks, so I think I may have to get a new one at some point, but we'll see. 
  - I really don't care about being a beginner; I mean, you have to learn somehow. There is no shame in 
    learning. I actually had someone tell me they de-friended me on github because I was a beginner LOL.
    Everyone learns...somehow. I don't think that's anything to be ashamed of. Sorry. I think it's also
    an accomplishment when someone grows into a really great developer and you had a part in that; you 
    can see how far someone has come. I think that that attitude is a better one than scoffing people 
    because they're learning. If you want your community to grow..you *should* encourage people learning.
    This is one thing (of many) I think Rust *gets right* in their community.
    
 ## I also
  - I want to visit my parents at some point next year. It looks like it might ideally be near my birthday,
    which would be pretty awesome, but I really don't know what the next few months will look like, so we'll
    see. People aren't the friendliest here compared to where I'm from (in terms of being friendly just to be friendly)
    . Where I'm from is a lot smaller and the people
    are super friendly. And I'm homesick. So that's been really bumming me out. So it usually means I have to muster up energy
    and keep trying, particularly in the Haskell community. It looks easy but it actually takes up a lot of energy for me.
    A few experiences really bummed me out and I'm feeling
    like after GSoC, I want to take a break for a bit. GSoC requires that you participate in the community
    and not lurk. I'll continue to write Haskell because I love it, but I'll probably just 
    communicate with one or two people, like my GSoC mentors, who are awesome. 
    I might even disconnect a few accounts (like Twitter and Reddit)
    and just stay away for a bit to recharge.
  - For those who know me, I stopped responding on my Twitter account after an extremely awful experience. One person
  didn't want me to be there and did everything (and still does!) in their power to prevent me from being a part
  of the community. This is a pretty common occurrence for females in the community, but it's worse when it's corroborated
  by other people. I felt (and still feel to some extent) isolated.
  I don't think
    I'll be interacting directly for a while. I sort of need a break. But I'll be back and definitely always be a part
    of the community.
  - It's just that when I interact with other communities (even if it's just on the surface), such as Racket, they're 
    *so* welcoming. And then I wonder if I'm doing it wrong by wasting all this time and energy in Haskell-land. But
    I *love* Haskell so much. I enjoy working on learning and I can't step away from writing Haskell every day :(
    
  ## Anyways
   - That's about it
