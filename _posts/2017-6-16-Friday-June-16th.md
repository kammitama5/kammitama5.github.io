## Nanodegree Scholarship from Udacity!

- Came home from our first Mathematics for CS Meetup.
  It was great meeting everyone.
  
- One the way home, got a text from a classmate 
  about a beer pong CS party tomorrow evening hahaha.
  That depends on how I feel after tomorrow's session from 9 to 6pm.
  
- I also have some corrections to make for my Coding for Product Workshop.
  Hopefully can get that work done, along with some of the workshop work
  tomorrow during the day.
  
## Got home and saw this in my inbox!

- So amazing! I'm so so thankful to be a part of the 
  Tech community. It's been amazing how wonderful 
  they've been to me, and I'm just really happy
  to be a part of it!
