## Helms-a-Lee!

## Yeup..went sailing again today!

- Man, was it fun! 

- I did get about 70 percent of my Programming done due August 25th, so I'm a bit ahead.

- In the meantime, I'd like to get in sailing once to twice a week, and eventually do some racing.

## Some pics!

## This is Avanti. 

- She used to be called *Aurora*, but was bought by a private seller
  and fixed up and renamed *Avanti*. I was told who it may belong to,
  but I'm not sharing (sorry, not on a public blog!).
