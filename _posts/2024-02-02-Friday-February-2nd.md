## My Second week as a Visiting Researcher

## It's been a week
- Do I feel jaded about the opportunity? Absolutely not!
- Do I feel comfortable? I didn't start out that way. I stayed at home Monday through Wednesday, working from home.
It was raining, and I have an inexpensive grocery store next to where I am staying, which makes it easy to rationalize
not going anywhere except for groceries, when needed. That changed, however, once I attended the reading group on
Pseudorandomness online on Wednesday evening. For one, the room was packed. Secondly, the scientist leading the group
did so much to include me, even though I was the only person online during the session. I decided that I absolutely
did have to make it to the lab on Thursday.
- I did not regret it. The energy here is insane. We have tea time at 3pm each day, researchers are writing on
white boards, and quite frankly, I've been *so* productive in the lab. A friendly wave in the morning and a "Good morning"
greeted me, as a fellow researcher sat next to me, and we were off to work, except to stop for coffee and tea breaks,
or occasional friendly chatter. There are zoom rooms for those who want to attend meetings. What is wonderful is that,
being so productive, I've been able to celebrate wins, when I have been able to focus long enough on a problem that
I make headway.
- Things seem "effortless" here, in that we just have what we need. What else does one need besides whiteboards,
friendly and collaborative people, coffee and tea, snacks, happy hour, open problem session, reading groups, and
soon...pitches for open research collaboration with smaller groups? It's just been a dream, and more than I could
have ever hoped for having had the opportunity to attend so far.
- Oh, there was also a Theoretical Computer Science conference this week, which I heard was really awesome! I tried to
get work done this week, so I skipped out on it, but a paper I had read after being recommended to me this summer was
presented at the workshop (in fact, the author had 2 or 3 papers in the workshop!). I did, however, head to the 1st floor
to scout some macarons during Tea time. I must have tried about six, but my friend (a postdoc), was right in telling me that
the vanilla and pistachio ones were probably the tastiest!

## Wandering
- Every time I meet up with my host, they are so kind to me, and they treat me with respect and with the promise that
I, too, can be a senior researcher in this community, and it fills me with so much joy.
- This week, I also wandered a couple streets in the "wrong" direction, visited the Physics building and got to see
the Oppenheimer display, and even chatted casually with a Psychedelics undergraduate major on campus.
- I got to see and hear some of my labmates make music while I could hear the rain outside, while eating macarons.
- To be honest, I haven't met any undergraduate Computer Science majors on campus, but I have met undergrads majoring in Physics,
Economics and of course, Psychedelics. I've been able to see students weave in and out on their scooters down Bancroft,
while others casually chatted with each other, holding cups of boba drinks.
- It's been a welcome respite and to top it off, I heard that I got funding to two Post-Quantum Cryptography workshops
today, so I guess I'll be going to those in a couple months; one is in Toronto, and the other is in Pasadena, California!
I'm very much looking forward to it all!
- In other news, I had been craving rice balls all week, and skipped Happy Hour drinking and eats this evening to find
them, and I regret nothing!

- I took notice of this, which is near the lab, because this particular plant actually grew in our yard growing up.
We call it the "bottle-brush tree". Alas, it grows no more in our yard, but I saw this by the lab and immediately
it warmed my heart!

- The name of this church, which is strangely the closest to campus, is also the name of the church I spent the most
time in growing up. So many things seem so nostalgic and familiar, like visiting a place for the first time, while
feeling like you've been there before.

## And that's it
