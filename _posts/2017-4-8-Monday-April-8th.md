## 4/10/17 - Return from BayHac


Personal: 

Came back from BayHac. I am exhausted, and sick. 
Had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Specifically, the most interesting to me
were topics on:

- -Adjunctions
- -Tensorflow Integration with Haskell API
- -Free Monads
- I would like to spend time for the rest of this year strengthening my knowledge of Category Theory. 
- I may have a mentor in mind


Things completed: 

- Set up Blog with Liz via online chat
- Forked template, configured Git
- Updated file in markdown and see if blog works
