## Hello from Zurich!

## Zurich has evaded me for the longest time...
- Finally, I was able to make it. Best of all, because I had to fly out of SF, it was a direct flight. We love those!
- It's been pretty fun here since I got here; I got to meet Chloe, regular name in the isogenies community, as well
as a bunch of other cool Maths PhD students. I even got to see Tatiana remotely (who I met in Berkeley and who is
affiliated with SL Math).
- Our workshop is at IBM Research, and it's only the second time they've hosted researchers here. I think the deal is
that they hope some of us will want to return to do an internship or something, but most mathematicians aren't really
thinking about that kind of stuff, which quite frankly is a bit refreshing compared to the average CS student, for whom internships can be about leveraging brand-name and levelling-up to other companies they want to join (so using
other companies as a stepping stone rather than just enjoying the growth and work for its own sake).
Also, I learned that there is always a spot held for one researcher from an agency; as you may or may not know, they
are the largest employer of mathematicians. That was also interesting (regardless of what your thoughts are of them)
because it was a non-platformed way to meet someone who actually works there, and that person was really just
down-to-earth and quite frankly, lovely to meet, with zero ego, but also incredibly knowledgable.
- One of the things that is really important to me is continuing to be better in my Maths journey, so I appreciated
that they did mention that their skills were strengthened by working there, and they have quite an extensive
library and resources related to that.
- We did have a career panel featuring Vadim and Jonathan from IBM Research, and Chloe from U Bristol, moderated
by Luca. Also, the talks were a mix of slides and board talks, and we had both assignments in proofs and those
requiring the use of SageMaths / Python.
- Oh, and they have a set of student presentations, so I get to say I gave a talk at IBM Research, I guess, too!

## On the weekends
- So I actually have been spending my evenings working at IBM Research; they gave me a space to work out of, which
was really really nice of them! And I've been making progress on my internship and even gave a presentation
from their office (I'm not an employee (nor do I want to be, quite frankly, and years ago did have an opportunity to join, but the work was not what I wanted to do; they wanted me to do work more on AI and trustworthy AI / provable fairness, but I opted for an internship focused more on security instead, which I care more about), but I just needed a space that was quiet and had a board to work from
in the evenings). So I have to admit I didn't end up doing as much exploring as some of the other students.
I really like my research project and working with the people at my internship, so I wanted to keep that up.
- We had an opportunity to give ten-minute talks on our work, so naturally, I signed up to do this.
- However, on the weekends, I did eat at some places, go to see some of the Costume Festival and that sort of thing.
Oh, and my phone randomly started not charging and dying, so that led me to an journey of finding a local
electronics phone-repair technician, who was excellent.

## July 4th
- I celebrated American Independence in Zurich in a karaoke bar with our group. Unexpectedly, some of the instructors came in!
There was a lot of screaming and hollering when we saw them, so much so that another person sitting next to me who was not in
our group asked if they were perhaps Swiss celebrities.
- Later (around 1am), six of us decided to walk home instead of take an Uber (there is no Lyft here...yet), and that took us
about an hour, but it was a really fun walk. I was still up afterwards, so I ended up doing laundry.

## The Last day
- On the last day, we had a couple more lectures and then I did my student presentation, which was well-received! So much so,
actually, that one of the researchers at IBM said that they wanted to know when our paper will come out (which is soon; within a week
or so!) so that they could cite it, as they are doing similar work but using different methods! Also, they said that it was an
area no one was really working on, so they were excited by the work I was doing!
- After the presentations, they took agency guy to a room and sang a version of "There's a Party in the US" to custom lyrics about him. It was very fun and nice of them to do that; he was quite well-loved at the workshop and people enjoyed that he was so nice
about asking questions, really humble and just cool. Someone suggested if they did want to recruit PhD Maths students, they should
ask him, and he did say he might go for JMM or something like that.
- Finally, I went with a friend to a couple chocolate shops, and found a chocolate from my home country! So I had to buy it,
and apparently it was a limited edition! I was able to pack and hilariously, the people at the airport just wanted to know
how Grenada and Tobago was doing because of the hurricane when they saw my passport. I appreciate their concern, too!
