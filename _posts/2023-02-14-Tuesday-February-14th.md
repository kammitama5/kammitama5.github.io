## Day Two of the Math Heaven!

## Second Day
- So today there were quite a few talks on Machine Learning, including Marc's talk on using ML to formulate conjectures,
which had to do with knot theory (I don't know a lot about this, except barely what a trefoil is, and I just learned a teeny bit about
Seifert Surfaces today). Then Leo gave an incredibly inspiring talk on Lean; I attended a talk by him about two weeks ago online for 
a completely different community interestingly, but he is always so passionate and it's crazy to see how much the community has grown.
I loved that he made the point that when we say a proof is "trivial" or obvious, that can't work in formal verification. He also spoke
about issues of scalability.
- I loved the commutatitive diagram usability feature, and he mentioned some interesting papers like that on [Hypertree proof search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11491.pdf)
and some great tools like Lean Chat, Lean Aide and the paper on [SAT Solvers for Boolean Pythagorean Triples](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/publications/ptn.pdf)
and interestingly, the first author was sitting next to me.
- There was also a really cool talk on using reinforcement learning for finding counterexamples, where we formulate our conjecture as a game,
specify a policy and reward, and examples of what worked and what did not. Haniel gave a talk on SMT proofs which felt a lot closer to something
I might expect to hear at POPL or something, and even mentioned Z3, which I had heard about in 2018 from Nadia at UCSD, I think.
Finally, Anne gave a talk in computation which was fascinating, because they spoke about what it means to do computation as a mathematician
vs a computer scientist. An example is something like ```1 + 1 = 2``` where we would have to unroll or unwrap the computation to obtain
an equivalent result. They spoke about definitional equality and the fragility of definitional equality and proof by reflection. I loved
the final message, which was that "clinging to one notion of computation causes tonnes of frustration. We should bridge the gaps flexibly".

## Unexpectedly
- So I was walking home, thinking I would settle in early evening, and for some strange reason, I thought maybe I should see if the lunch
cafeteria was still open (they have a Veggie Grill!). As it turns out, I didn't end up going there, but I did run into my friend who is
an Algebraic Topologist and does Homotopy Type Theory and is doing their postdoc there. And I met another Homotopy Type Theorist, and then
another, and we ended up hanging out in their office and then going out to eat Indian food together. So now I know two more Algebraic
Topologists apparently now. And I got to see what the postdoc life looks like at UCLA, which looks amazeballs. They have blackboards
and their own office, with a view.

- I'm literally the reason that country is on there! How cool!

## And that's it
