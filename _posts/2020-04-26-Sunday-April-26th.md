## The Horror and Hegemony

## I gave a talk at CMU's Symposium called AI for Good
- I was supposed to present a poster at CMU, but the event went virtual,
  so I was told I'd have 5 minutes to give a talk. These are my slides (bottom of post).
- Basically, it was one of the most horrifying moments ever for me because I realized
  there were between 60 and 90 people there, and notifications were going off in the chat,
  and I couldn't see the right hand side of my screen and the clock was ticking. But it was
  so relieving, I was thankful for the opportunity and heard from persons afterwards who wanted
  to keep in touch with me about the progress of the project.
- What I got out of it was to be able to speak about a project I'm working on, to hear what other people
  are working on, and that was a thrilling process and I want to do that over and over.
  
## I got into the project by accident
- I was searching for a project in class, and found a friend and classmate who was interested in
  working on a project in conjunction with the Economics department. Something about that was compelling to me.
  Maybe I just wanted to get away from the ego of Computer Science. Sometimes I feel like half of my mind
  is very passionate about Computer Science, programming, and tech, and the other part of me is ground down
  by the arrogance and ego that is associated with the culture in that field. And that part just wants
  a break. 
- I found a cool spot on campus in that Department after I met with the professor, 
  and I never really returned to hanging out in my
  Department as much again. I took naps in that spot, ate lunch and would listen to the professors greet each other
  in the morning. I became familiar with the office dog of the floor. 
  
## The work 
- It's on work we're doing on implicit bias, in a way that might be helpful to the city. But we're trying to do it 
  in a way that is sensitive to the collection of data, privacy, the history of conflict of the town, issues like
  trust and transparency and with the knowledge that there are things that data (which is a proxy) can't properly
  communicate. 
- It had me thinking about the way the process of an SRE is to provide a robust model that improves over time,
  and that helps developers; you are there to faciliate them. It's an interesting correlation to how we can think of
  data collection and data modelling.
- I am not the biggest fan of downloading data from the internet and just using that. I'm highly sensitive to the idea
  that data is a proxy and a codified choice, yet there are so many fields that use it as a way of validating accuracy
  for a specific point of view. Coming from a film background, where we engaged in critical theory, and discussed that
  a camera, even with the promise of objectivity, is not, it's easy for me to have issues with the concept of "data as truth".
  
## It's a highly relevant topic
- Machine Learning is very data-centric. There are wonderful individuals dealing specifically with these challenges, and 
  I was very pleased today to hear from some of them in keynotes during ICLR's Trust and Privacy track today. 

## It's also relevant
- I am particularly sensitive to this topic not just because of my film background (where we spoke about topics like hegemony
  and objectification in recorded images), but also because they cover issues of consent and privacy (privacy, being my focus
  for grad school), and also because I am from a country with a rich history in grappling with the ideas and memory of 
  postcolonialism. And I'm frustrated because ego in a field makes things difficult to explain..until we hurt people. Or 
  they revolt. I joked that we should have a Hegemonic Index for measuring this relationship in data. Maybe it's not that funny
  of a joke and it's worth considering.
  
## Anyways...
- My friend recommended some books. I've bought them.
- One is "The Ethical Algorithm" by Kearns and Roth and the other is "Privacy: A short history" by Vincent.
  If any of this resonates with you, I'd definitely recommend both!
  
## Oh yeah, my slides
