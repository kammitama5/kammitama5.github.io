## GSoC and RustReach Day 41

## Jetlag
- Since my flight got in at midnight, I was really tired today. However, I managed
  to get my rent together, pay all my bills for the month, and get some groceries.
  I have to submit my receipts for reimbursement for PLDI, but am ok. I mostly
  feel energized to continue.
- I also saw my photo in this article! It's called ["Hackathon Review and
  Stack Maintenance"](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/06/hackathon-review-and-stack-maintenance).
  Thank you to Michael for supporting me. I have to say that interacting with him, I have only really
  good, positive things to say about him. He's encouraged me.
- I also got my branch merged. I made a mistake and forgot a function..or rather, lost it. Yikes.
  I really need to work on getting less sloppy. I know that that comes with experience, but it
  *really* bugs me. It might have happened when I was working on the plane, because the person
  in front of me leaned their chair back, and my laptop wasn't flat, and the meal table was *so* tiny :D
  I think that's the first time I couldn't wait to get off the plane to push my commits up.
  
## I had my Rust meeting with my mentor
- I really enjoyed it. We're a good fit. He told me about how the type-checker works. 
  You can read a bit about it [here](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/type-checking.html).
- I'll be picking what I'll be working on for the following six to nine weeks this week, from the [working
  cli group.](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/cli-wg/issues). The three that immediately look interesting
  to me are error handling, testing and file-system abstractions. But I want to build a project this week and
  fail in Rust, first, as that will give me a lot of feedback on a lot of stuff. So that's my goal this week,
  along with starting on the GSoC debugger feature I'm working on.
  
 ## I also finally saw
 - Ranjit's videos. The funny thing is that since he won the award, those are some of the first things that pop
   up when you google him :D They're actually pretty funny. I especially enjoyed the Ramen in the shape of a lambda.
   
 ## I also have papers to read
 - I have papers to read this week. I can download those and read them during the week.
 
 ## Staying up to do Haskell
 - Today was mostly a "day off" to recover, but I may end up staying up to do some Haskell until the early morning from
   the book. Just to keep going.
   
 ## That's about it.
