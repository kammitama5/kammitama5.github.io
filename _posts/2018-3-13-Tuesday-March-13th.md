## Fortran and stuff

## Here is a Fortran Programme I wrote today

- It basically takes a bunch of STDIN inputs until it gets to the end of the file,
  and then gives you the maximum and minimum value. 
  
- Getting the largest was easy (just replace it if the read-in value is larger than your current value, which
  is the largest). For the smallest, I had to remember to initialize the value, or your smallest would be 
  zero by the end of the do loop (assuming that there are no negative values).
  
## This was the output

- The smallest number in my list is 3 and the largest is 98. This is in Fortran 95.
  
- Things are a little repetitive but some of it makes sense. Then again, I'm just learning
  for a class. I have to write a COBOL programme for next week, also (fun fun! Speaking of 
  "wordy" lol).

## I also submitted a talk

- I don't know if I'll get in, but it's on Denotational Semantics, which I'm learning about,
  and Haskell. It's a short talk, but I thought I'd try to talk about something I'm 
  passionate about. It's about preserving the meaning in a programme and involves some lambda calculus.
  
## And applications

- I'm rushing to complete this one application, and trying to do due diligence on another.
  No guarantees, but it's worth a shot and I'll give both my all. 
  
## And other stuff...

- I'm helping with the Board of this committee affiliated with a conference, and helping a 
  well-known computer scientist with some research that isn't necessarily academic, but 
  is good to just work on in general. I like doing that stuff, so I figure why not. 
  
## Random

- Someone recruited me for a Clojure job today. lol. I don't...write...Clojure. 
  I seem to get the weird ones...Clojure, Scala, Mathematica, Haskell, PureScript...those 
  are the things I seem to get, which is funny. Oh, and I got recruited for a robotics gig
  randomly as well the other day. 
  
## I'm really excited

- I'm excited about LambdaConf. I hope that it all works out and I can go, but who knows. 
  Taking it one day at a time.
