## Forms are terrible, and other life advice

## I've spent my last few days thinking about forms
- I joined this group and we're working on a project, and I'm part of the data team. 
  And we were working on form information to collect data. I'm humbled that we have some
  incredibly bright and thoughtful persons working on the team. Throughout our discussions,
  it became incredibly clear how terrible forms are.
- But I've know this. You see, back in the days of this young'un appylying to United States
  universities, they would *mostly* ask for a zip code. Application after application would not
  let you hit that submit button unless you put in a state and a zip code, and well, my country of birth has *neither*. Very quickly, we learned that
  you could put in "99999" or "00000" as the zip code, or use a random State (I've never tried Nevada; why not?) in a drop-down. You could not submit unless you picked "some state" so a random one is as good as any, right? But sometimes the form wouldn't accept
  "00000". So you'd hope "99999". I think for one form, it didn't work, so I just put in a random
  zip code. I mean, it's not *technically* lying if the form is terrible and there is no other
  way to get it to submit, right? They were all pretty terrible.


## So this week
- This past week I started reading this rather brief book that talks about data and ethnography called
  ["Technically Wrong"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38212110-technically-wrong). The first 100 pages that I've been through talk about inappropriate and failing
  usability design. But reading through it, I've felt that these examples felt *so familiar*.
  Of course they did; when I was living in my country of birth, you became *painfully aware* that those
  forms or those designs weren't really designed for you, so we would "hack" our way around them.
- My family has a long history using things like Skyboxes or myself (the personal Skybox) en-route to ship things, either when
  they are needed brand new or are being repaired in the United States. What happens a lot is that 
  on trips to the United States or other places, my family of techies will see something that is interesting
  and useful, purchase it, and all is well. But then, it *breaks*. And unfortunately, these items were never
  meant to be serviced in places that weren't the United States. The result is a comical recommender system
  that is perpetually confused, as it cannot tell whether I am the person requesting an item, or whether it 
  is one of my parents. Our technology is not so sophisticated yet. 
- This is a story all too familiar to any immigrant living in the United States, with family living outside of the
  United States. Many years ago, perhaps we stuffed our suitcases with new sneakers and pairs of socks for our nephews
  and cousins. Today, it is with digital amenties that delight when they are first brought to us, but are a pain when
  they experience wear and tear. 
  
## Imagine this (A true story)
- Imagine this: a daughter has bought her father a Kindle. However, when he logs into his Kindle, it wants to authenticate his 
  account by sending [two-factor auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) to his daughter via *her* mobile phone. This means that he has to text her and ask her
  about the number that was sent to *her phone* (because United States numbers required only of course) to unlock *his Kindle*.
  And this is a timed transaction, so it has to be done before the transaction times out. 
- In the age of companies looking to make profits, and hiring many immigrants whose families live outside of the United States,
  unfortunately this isn't really a thing that seems to matter...shrug.
  
## But back to those forms
- Why do I care about forms? Well, because forms are the pipeline to data; the data we in Data Science, Machine Learning
  and AI take for granted. If we don't have an understanding for and healthy skepticism for the way our data is collected,
  can we really call ourselves "scientists" at all? Are we analysts? A friend and I were having this discussion this weekend.
  If we accept this lack of skepticism about the way our data is collected, the way it is encoded, archived and used, what
  does that mean for the future of our field? What does that mean for the future of *us*?
  
## So I asked my friend
- I reached out to my friend, the *wise* one, who I looked at with wonder about how he had so much insight about how forms
  should be designed and I asked him "how can I learn from you? I want to learn how to do this better". And he told me a bit
  about his background and made some recommendations. And I've been musing about it ever since. 
- Looking back, today I wonder about those forms and whether if they had taken the time to ask someone like myself about 
  how we would use them, if they might have been designed differently. 
- A while ago, I was registering for an event hosted by a governmental agency, and the gentleman registering me asked me 
  "Which is it? Is it Trinidad OR Tobago? Pick one!". I tried to explain to him that they were together; it's *one* 
  twin-island republic. Triumphantly, after he looked it up, he responded that "I was right" (as though I could not validate
  for myself the very place that I was born). It was a comical but tragic incident, but it speaks more broadly to the relationship 
  we as people who analyze and collect data, and those who give up their data have. Do we see the data and think as data scientists or
  analysts that for it to be authentic, we alone can validate it? Are we authoratative in a way that diminishes the experiences and 
  inputs of the very people we collect data from? Or do we see ourselves as participatory and collaborative, as part
  of a wider process. 

## I guess I've been thinking about this a lot
- I was asking someone the other day "How do you know when a problem or project is *done*"? When is something *enough*. The Computer Scientist 
  and agile process says that you should specify when something is done, and that's how you know a project is over. 
  It's a very neat, convenient way for someone in Computer Science
  to think about a problem, but that isn't really how things work in the real world, isn't it? 
- A mechanic knows this isn't the case, as things are a trade-off. You make a fix, but something else may come loose or rattle. Your tires may
  need to be aligned. Your fan belt is rattling again. Doctors know this to be the case, too; someone can experience little to no symptoms,
  but that doesn't mean that they are fully cured, or that they will be cured *forever*. It seems to be only the computer scientist without
  systems thinking who sees the world this way. Even artists complete paintings but know that a painting is never really done. 
- When you work on systems that are supposed to help humans, interact with humans, then, how do we measure what "done" is? Humans are all so 
  different, this may never be the case. So how is that expected to fit into a system if we are all such anomalies? It's a question that's difficult
  to answer, but there are many fields that have already explored such topics. 
  
## And that's it
