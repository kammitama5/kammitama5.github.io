## GSoC Day 62

## I'm pretty tired

## Bobby Findler shows us his Haiku programme
  - He rewrote one that had extremely ugly syntax in JavaScript, 
    made it more elegant and preserved the meaning.

## We ended up going out for Greek food in the evening
 
  - And explaining dependent type syntax, which I actually hadn't
    seen before. I believe Alex and Will were chatting about it.

## We ended up having dessert at the Porpupine Grill.
  - Corban, Kyle and myself walked back to campus afterwards.
    I got less than two hours of sleep and then checked out and shared
    an Uber with Dimitri and my roommate, Lindsey.

## I'm going to take a nap
  - And then get up to do some work. This is the last push over the next five weeks, so I'll
    be *super* busy, and may take time off from my PT gig to just get stuff done. This is
    the final push!
