## My Summer Internship

## I did another research internship!
- It was in the Bay, and I was in the Advanced Cryptography team! I can't give more details specifically about
the project, but I am (1) very excited about the project (2) definitely seeing that it will lead to a publication.
- It was a really great experience, because it is also one of the (few) research spaces that also (1) feels like
a research lab; there are whiteboards everywhere and people do collaborate regularly (2) cares a lot about security;
a lot of that culture is embedded into the fabric of the company, so it really is a great place to go for anything
related to that (3) doesn't pressure you to work on research that will benefit the company in terms of a product
or being applied. You can literally work on something that will not benefit the company in any way at all,
and it's fine. Additionally, their schedule was hybrid in terms of people mostly working between a remote and
in-office schedule, which was really great. Also, the interns were all really very nice!
- I got to meet the Mayor of SF, the mascot from the SF Giants and the 49ers Mascots and take photos with them,
among other things. There were team socials, like go-karting and an ice-cream social, and for the interns
several social events including one in SF in which our group of interns took a really fancy ride back because
we had pooled our resources together to get a rideshare back, and another in which we painted!
- A highlight for me was meeting the co-founder of elliptic curve cryptography in my first week, as well as attending
a quantum day event on my second day of my first week (with Professor Lange and Professor Jacques). So many great things. People were just so nice.
- I visited friends in the Bay, including friends from various companies (OpenAI, Google, Nvidia, etc). I missed
out on a final social at Netflix, but there is always another time. It's wild that I have so many friends here,
when I am one of the hardest people to get to come out of my accommodations on the East Coast, or to socialize
in general. It felt like every weekend I was out in the Bay. I'm super thankful to have had the time to meet
up with every single one of you; I had such a memorable time!!!
- I made friends with an awesome roommate, we were inseparable and had a really great time this summer, including
a last day of being picked up in a Tesla to get a massage by the owner of a massage shop, going out for dim sum,
eating way too much Tong Sui, and all of those good things.
- I also got to go to the summer research Maths workshop at IBM Research Zurich! There was so much that happened
this summer, and more to come as I head to a quantum simulation summer school!

## Anyways
- Here are some photos

- Just the interns. Only two of us are new; the other three are return interns. People come 2 times, 3 times here.

- After I returned from Zurich, we had an ice-cream social at Salt N Straw in Burlingame.

- Last evening with my roomie. Yes, my hair is a different colour. Living in the Bay will do that to you, I guess. I've gotten lots of compliments.

## And that's it!
