## Artificial Intelligence people are a little...strange

## The header is totally a quote
- We were at this bar at 3 in the morning, and the vibe was CRAZY. The group of us (the Maths geeks, who
started talking about sphere-packing and Category Theory) were dancing to Abba, talking about the Riemann
Hypothesis and just having a good time. On the way out, the bartender / owner of the bar was talking to us.
- She asked us if we were visiting, and we said yeah, we're here for a conference. Then she said "Artificial
Intelligence?" and we nodded. Then she said "Oh, I've seen some of those people. They're...strange. I can't
tell even when they get drunk if they're human." It was kind of a hilariously insightful statement.
She said that when her usual customers came in, partied, drank, there was something very joyful and human
about that, and she hoped that the future still had that. What an insight.

## Today was wonderful
- I hosted the last session for our workshop, but got distracted talking to some recruiters who were super
nice (!!) and ended up missing the final photo op for the organizers (!!). What was I thinking lol. Anyways,
after that, I headed back with my laptop, took a shower and headed to where a bunch of us planned to meet for
dinner. Little did I know, that dinner would take us until close to 4 in the morning.
- For one of us, it was their first conference, and it was really wonderful to see how much fun everyone
was having, including this person. This really set the bar pretty high. We went bar-hopping, chatted, hugged,
danced, ate food, and just had a fantastic time.
- The common thread apparently for all of us was that we liked Maths, apparently, Who would have even thought?
It was quite by accident. But I really had an amazing time and it was the highlight of the conference! I can't
remember the last time I stayed out so late and just had a blast like that in a new city in Europe. Fantastic!
