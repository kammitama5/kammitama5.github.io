## Happy 1st!

## So...

- I'm going to this talk tonight at JPL, at [Von Karman](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/events/lectures.php). 
  The speaker is particularly inspiring to me.
  He's a Lebanese Immigrant who came from a small village
  and became a rocket scientist at JPL, heading missions
  like the Curiosity Rover, etc. 
  
- His name is Charles Elachi, and he retired last year
  from JPL as director. You can find the article
  [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/09/22/how-america-turned-me-from-a-lebanese-immigrant-into-a-nasa-rocket-scientist/?utm_term=.e350d7caf3a0).
  
## Update

- I got a picture with Charles Elachi! He has an asteroid named after him! 
  I also got caught in the middle of an interview with my mentor, who works at JPL,
  and his brother, who also worked there. 
  A really nice journalist, Govinda, is interviewing engineers at JPL,
  which I think is a really great idea! There are so many *great* stories
  that are not told because the media focuses on astronauts.
  
  Here is my photo with Dr. Elachi. He is so nice, and really smart,
  and has a great sense of humour. It made me sad that I won't be working
  under him, since he retired already, if I intern at JPL, but I'm happy
  to get a chance to be part of that legacy. It was really a wonderful
  evening!
  
  Note the LambdaConf tshirt hehe. That was deliberate :)

## I'm attending the Coding for Product Workshop!

- I just have to do the exercise and fill out the application,
  but the person leading the workshop wants me to attend.
  So I'm determined to complete the application by 
  the end of this weekend, and fingers-crossed,
  I'll have a spot in mid-June :)
  I'm excited to learn and be a part of the project
  
  
## I'm starting my June UnBootcamp workshop!

- I got some great feedback, and will be 
  implementing that tomorrow during the day,
  and possibly in the evening.
  
## I completed the Programming for Correctness class!

- I'm currently auditing, but it may be worthwhile
  for me, since I got 100 percent, to just get the
  certificate. I have until July 14th(??) to decide.
  I'll probably get it by July 1st.
  It's a *great* class to learn predicate logic,
  and how it relates to programming.

- I wasn't able to complete the notes in LaTeX,
  but maybe if I have time in the future,
  I will! I'll continue to write mathematical
  notation in LaTeX, thouugh. It's so clean
  and useful, and helps me in learning about
  and remembering mathematical notation,
  which ties into functional programming and
  category theory, too. Plus, it's just so
  nice-looking :)
  

## I have to finish one more lab

- My notes are written for my exam,
  so I just have to finish the lab in C++.
  Pretty much, after that mini-exam 
  this upcoming Tuesday, I study 
  for my final exam, which is on the 13th,
  and then I'm done.
  
## Project Euler back again...Question 20

- I solved a problem from Project Euler.
  Pretty easy.
  You find 100! and then make it a 
  string and sum the digits.
  
  ```
  def factorial(n):
  total = 1
  total1 = 0
  for i in range(1, 100):
    total = total * i 
    
  d = str(total)
  for i in d:
    total1 = total1 + int(i) 
  print total1
  
  return 

  # Produces 648.

  ```
  
  
## Found a neat new FP group based in OC. 
  
- It's called [Functional Programming OC](https://www.meetup.com/Orange-Combinator-Functional-Programming-In-OC/).

## POPL
- Found out the next [POPL](http://popl18.sigplan.org/home)
  will be in Los Angeles for 2018

- Hope I can attend that!

## Spent the afternoon

- Reading up on [Co-Monads](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2017/01/02/comonads/).
  I got to Bartosz's lectures again. 
  I should just start going through his lectures.
  I'm also looking at Spivak's book. It's up there
  on my Wishlist.
  It's called "Category Theory for the Sciences".
  You can find an old version [here](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/CT4S.pdf).
