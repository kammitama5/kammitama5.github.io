## Happy 1st!

## So...

- I'm going to this talk tonight at JPL, at Von Karman. 
  The speaker is particularly inspiring to me.
  He's a Lebanese Immigrant who came from a small village
  and became a rocket scientist at JPL, heading missions
  like the Curiosity Rover, etc. 
  
- His name is Charles Elachi, and he retired last year
  from JPL as director. You can find the article
  [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/09/22/how-america-turned-me-from-a-lebanese-immigrant-into-a-nasa-rocket-scientist/?utm_term=.e350d7caf3a0)
 
 
## I'm attending the Coding for Product Workshop!

- I just have to do the exercise and fill out the application,
  but the person leading the workshop wants me to attend.
  So I'm determined to complete the application by 
  the end of this weekend, and fingers-crossed,
  I'll have a spot in mid-June :)
  I'm excited to learn and be a part of the project
  
  
## I'm starting my June UnBootcamp workshop

- I got some great feedback, and will be 
  implementing that tomorrow during the day,
  and possibly in the evening.
  
## I completed the Programming for Correctness class!

- I'm currently auditing, but it may be worthwhile
  for me, since I got 100 percent, to just get the
  certificate. I have until July 14th(??) to decide.
  I'll probably get it by July 1st.
  It's a *great* class to learn predicate logic,
  and how it relates to programming.

## I have to finish one more lab

- My notes are written for my exam,
  so I just have to finish the lab in C++.
  Pretty much, after that mini-exam 
  this upcoming Tuesday, I study 
  for my final exam, which is on the 13th,
  and then I'm done.
  
  
## Found a neat new FP group based in OC. 
  
- It's called [Functional Programming OC](https://www.meetup.com/Orange-Combinator-Functional-Programming-In-OC/)

## POPL
- Found out the next [POPL](http://popl18.sigplan.org/home) 
  will be in Los Angeles for 2018

- Hope I can attend that!

## Spent the afternoon

- Reading up on Co-Monads.
  I got to Bartosz's lectures again. 
  I should just start going through his lectures.
  I'm also looking at Spivak's book. It's up there
  on my Wishlist.
  It's called "Category Theory for the Sciences".
  You can find an old version [here](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/CT4S.pdf)
