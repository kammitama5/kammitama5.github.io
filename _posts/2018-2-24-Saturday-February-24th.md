## The most B@dass boat...

## So today, I was on this totally Bad@ss boat!

- It was a San Juan 33, and it had a tiller!

- The lady steering owns the boat, and used to be a scientist! 

- The company that made the boats went out of business!
  Her number is 122, but she thinks only about 22 were actually made. 
  Of those, she's only seen about 3, and they're mainly on the East Coast. 
  She had to put a fair amount (as much as the boat cost) into it to fix it up,
  redo the electrical, and it uses an electric engine, not diesel.
  
- You can read about SJ-33S boats [here](http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=854). Apparently,
the last one was made in '82 by Clark Boat Co.!

## Oh man...

- So I actually went to this workshop that was for people who were interested 
  in racing (or general sailing). A lot of people just want to day-cruise
  and that sort of thing. Day-cruising (especially on long trips) is nice,
  but racing is more exciting. It also tends to draw people more my age, too.
  
- There were two boats that wanted me (that I've sailed on), and a third to which
  I was assigned, that I had also done some work on (but I had never sailed on).
  So I picked that one. It had the tiller and the girl who owned it liked to race.
  Sounds good. 
  
## Little did I know
- I freaking LOVED it. It was *my* thing. It was so precise and so fast. She said 
  that it could take her 3.5 hours to get to Catalina, which I've done on other 
  boats in 6.5 hours! It was clean and the tiller really gives you that feel of 
  the boat with the wind. It leaves little margin for error. And it heels like a mofo!
  
## So some pics

- *This* is sailing, I thought. The boat was heeling and I was loving it. 
  We *had* to move to the high side strategically every time we tacked. 
  It was just...*amazing*. I had a lot of fun! I've read that the boat isn't 
  for *everyone*, but wow...I *loved* it! It was a lot of fun!
  
## On the way back

- There was a race about to happen so lots of boats...

## Yeah...

- This really doesn't have anything to do with code, but I *shall* be spending my day working on a data analysis project! :D
