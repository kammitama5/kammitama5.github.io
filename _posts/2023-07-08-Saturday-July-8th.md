## My PhD Teaching Fellowship in Austin

- I spend the past two weeks as one of two PhD teaching fellows at Austin this summer. It was one of the highlights of grad school for me.
- After last summer, I felt really burned out and miserable after my last internship, and wanted to have this summer to myself instead of to just
another corporation. I do not regret that choice to this day. This has been one of the most fun for me in terms of summers in grad school so far,
and we're still in the middle of it.

## Teaching Fellowship
- I applied a week before the deadline, prefacing it with "I probably won't get it, but..." and to my surprise, I got a spot! I could never
have anticipated how transformational and fantastic the opportunity was; the students were amazing, supportive and rooting for us, I learned
that, as one of the organizers said, "your intuition in teaching is spot on", and that you "are one of the most caring / empathetic teachers
we have ever had in our cohort". I also learned that I had a great ability to teach, and these are things that I would have rated myself
horribly for before having had this experience, because I was just not every self-aware in evaluating myself in this way. I also think that
in many disciplines like mine, there aren't very good opportunities to teach; teaching is seen more as labour and something you only do
if you don't have funding from other avenues. Here, it was something you put yourself into, we were given the space to try new things and
to fail, and to grow, and the experience was more than I could have ever asked for.
- On the final day, the other fellow for my module looked at me teary-eyed and said that she felt that I had really come into my own
over the past two weeks, and that I had this "sparkle" (as she called it) that really lit up the room and that was so clear between the
students and myself, and she was so grateful to have been there to experience all of this. I felt so grateful to have met every single
person in my cohort, and to feel like I could finally be in a space where I felt valued, validated, and could thrive and grow.
- A mentor met with me online and said that I was "ebullient" since I had been here, and that it made her feel so happy, too.
- Every day there was something to do, and often there was a steady stream of activity with either persons going out, hanging out in the
lounge of the 4th floor until 3am; it just went on and on. It was a space where I felt I could be myself, all of myself, and that has
been so rare since I started grad school.

## On the Final Day
- I began crying upon waking up, reading a student's message about sharing their final presentation, saying "you'd like it". I took a peek
and immediately tears were streaming down my face. The final presentations were all wonderful, and so personal and incorporated so much
of what we did over the past few weeks (I had covered everything from graphs using things like "Queer Ultimatum", glitch art, audio
spectrograms, blending of images, etc). It was super cool to see their journey from start to finish, and to be a part of that, and to
see how much joy they found in finding community with each other.
- Some of my favourite memories were their going to Rosita's for tacos and applauding in the elevator as they noisily made their way
to the bus, our group going to Kinokuniya and eating rotating sushi, karaoke, paddle-boarding and kayaking, watching Rush Hour at 2
in the morning, watching them play Quiplash, Patently stupid, Mario Party, solving 1000 piece puzzles and the Olympics tournament for
the grand first prize of a pack of cookies, or Jeopardy. Or even things like spending time watching fireworks on July 4th and deciding
instead of taking the bus back home and getting squished with everyone, walking back home instead (for about an hour), and finding a
bunny along the way. Or discovering someone would get Whataburger or In-n-out randomly at 1am in the lounge, while a group slunk off
to party on 6th street. There are so many memories and there are no words to explain how fun and incredible my experience was!
- I leave with so many new friends, a new academic family, feeling so affirmed and that for once, I could really enjoy that I did
get the opportunity not because I was lucky, or something else that dismisses who I am, but that "you stood out and we wanted you
to be a part of this"; the wonderful, incredible, immensely rewarding community where I found SO much joy!
- I wished so many times in my life when I was pursing things that brought me joy that I ALSO had a community like this one!
- Not going to lie; it was HOT and humid though!

## A picture tells a thousand words, so I can probably just post photos at this point.
