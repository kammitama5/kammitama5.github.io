## NanoDegree Cont'd and Robot workshop 

- Moving along today 
- I started on some basic CSS

We learned about Boxify-ing an image. 
- This is how I broke mine down.
  So I got 14 elements.

## And..I got some review of my notes from a Forum Mentor, so working on fixing stuff

## Really helpful! 

- I love how succinct but also helpful it is!

- I also posted the review here so that later on, I don't have to go back to the forum,
  (which has a degree of clutter from old posts),
  but can just look at my blog and make necessary adjustments.
  
- The one I posted is on a CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/kammitama5/pen/NgpMMN).

- I like the tool this mentor suggested : [Validitator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-validator/cgndfbhngibokieehnjhbjkkhbfmhojo/related?hl=en)

## I am going to a robotics workshop. 

- simple Robot...
- I found a cable for my Linux laptop, so was able
  to use my laptop without it draining out the battery.

## So...

- I didn't get to finish building my robot,
  but man is that stuff fun.

- Since I may finish my C++ classes after this one,
  I may take the year-long thesis robot-thingy in Spring/ Fall.
  That way, I'll get to do both some C++ and robotics stuff. 
  
- I still need to learn SPICE. Haven't really learned that yet,
  even though I know a bit of Eagle and Express PCB.
  
## Tomorrow...On a Journey

- So I finish my workshop tonight, and then am taking a bus
  early morning to San Francisco. So yeah...

## And..look who came back :)
