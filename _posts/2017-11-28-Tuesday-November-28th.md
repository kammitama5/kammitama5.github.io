## Buzz moves!

## Hi Everyone! 

- I've been busy working on my game.
  Good news! He moves and is animated! 
  Also, the WASD buttons work! You can also press Q to quit.
  Maybe I should change that, as they're so close to the WASD buttons. 
  That might be annoying...
  I actually set him to the bottom left so I can work on jumping, gravity and collision.
  So those are my next goals.
  
- This is actually for a class where I could have done something a lot easier, but...¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- Games... ARE... FUN! Something about it is just..liberating. And it's very fulfilling when
  things just..work.

## Also

- I'm on the waitlist for Discrete Structures! 
  I'm number 17...yayyyy :)
  
- I think regardless, I'll take this class, just because it's in C++.
  I had to kind of fight to even get on the waitlist, and now I know the 
  Chair of the Maths department, the Business school, and the Computer Science school.
  
- I even trolled and asked if they taught Category Theory :P (uh...they don't)

## I also stayed up late

- I was up late last night looking at [Sandy](https://github.com/isovector?page=2&tab=repositories) make a game in Haskell! 

- I actually learned quite a bit from just watching his hour and a half or so
  of [streaming on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/isovector), because I had just 
  learned about deltas, and he was doing things with .tmux files and making collision,
  friction, etc. Plus, he made some boosting/ attenuation. 
- It was really interesting to see, also, that he had to make his own library for [Clock](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.8.0.3/docs/Data-Time-Clock-POSIX.html).
  using [Posix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix).
  
## Also on Slack

- So I'm on a different Slack (haha I'm a serial Slacker!) :) 
  and they gave me great advice about just possibly doing some Haskell over the break.
  I have a coupon that expires after a year once I log in, so I was actually thinking of doing that,
  but it's in JS. But I'm not really *excited* about JS :/
- So Haskell and C++ it is over the break! 
- I'm probably going to just buy and work through the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com/), and in between, 
  try to keep working on my game or work on another game (perhaps using [Open GL](https://www.opengl.org/)).
- I need to understand Game Programming Algorithms/ Patterns in general. I think 
  they (Algorithms are people too) will make me a better programmer. 

## Coming up
- I'm going to SF and then Maryland over the next couple of days.
- I'm also decorating a boat! 
- I have an exam next week Wednesday (C++).
- I have an interview and a coding interview to do...yep..more professional stuff.

## And, that's about it!
