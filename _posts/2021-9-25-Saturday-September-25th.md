## More Mathematics and Growth

## This week, the study buddy-buddy
- This week, I started out attending a talk by Elizalde on "Descents on quasi-Sterling permutations". Every Monday, we have a talk
by either a local or visiting Combinatorics scholar, and this was my second week attending. I'm very much looking forward to this week's talk, too!
- The talk was also very accessible; he started by speaking about what Stirling permutations and Stirling polynomials are began to show us a number
of examples, including the distribution and graph representation, and the concept of non-crossing matchings in thinking about quasi-Stirling permutations.
- Later in the week, I attended 2 Number Theory talks; one on a generalization of "Elkie's Theorem" and the other on "Computing cusp forms over function fields".
- I also got to meet some other people in the department, some of whom apparently remembered me from around the department, which was really cool.
- I also had two study group sessions; both were fun, and it's become much of a habit, where we meet and work through different ways of approaching
problems. As I had noted, someone in [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-hard-is-it-to-major-in-math-What-is-the-intelligence-IQ-cutoff-to-do-well) repeated what I had said in a post, which is that you just need to be able to stick with a problem (in particular, look at Gross's answer, in which he says that 
"What has struck me is that math students are willing to commit to the grind, arguably more than CS students.").
- I'm beginning to think that it really is sort of an American culture thing to associate Mathematics as wizardry, for which one either can or cannot
know its secrets, but I'm open to having my mind changed on that discussion. There seems to be some inherent pride in that, when in many countries in
the world, students learn to do Mathematics without ascribing an ego or talent to a capacity to do it. You learn if you put in the work, and you solve problems
by sticking with them, turning them inside out and not willing to give up. 
What often is described as "a lack of capacity", as it turns out, is often a failure by the very institution to prepare students properly, as noted by another
Quora commentor. 100 percent on that. And that *can be fixed* if professor and student are dedicated to resolve this.
I also think it's a dangerous idea to push this idea of being this magical thing that is bestowed on a select few, when it is used actively to exclude
others. Because the truth is that it is a skill needed in some capacity in many disciplines, and by actively discouraging others at various levels,
we lack finding those with the skills to perform with these sorely needed skills. As someone else mentioned in an article, too, the lack of a broad
variety of perspectives and people who practice, also, can dissuade the next generation's crop from pursuing a field, if they begin to fall in love with
it, but feel isolated in their discipline.
- That being said, in Pure Mathematics, I haven't felt that way so far; in fact, I've never felt more included in a discpline, and I'm super happy about that. 
This week, I turned to one of my advisors and asked "What if I started over and did a PhD in Pure Maths instead?" and she laughed and said 
"oh, we would like that!". I've never felt *so* included in a discipline; I think less about whether I fit in, or whether people will speak to me
or make me feel included. I don't feel put down by anyone in my classes; I feel encouraged and happy, and work long hours because I enjoy the material.
I can imagine collaborating with *so* many people, and it all feels very organic and natural. I don't think about the names of schools or who is inaccessible
or forms cliques I will never be a part of; I just think of topics and which ones are interesting, and feel like reaching out is easy when a topic excites me.
I was telling my Combinatorics professor this week that "it finally feels like grad school", to which she smiled and said "great!".


## DMD or DND?
- I went to my first [Discrete Maths Day](https://sites.google.com/view/northeastcombinatoricsnetwork/fall-2021-discrete-math-day?authuser=0), and it was a lot of fun!
- We played [Quads](https://awm-math.org/publications/playing-cards/evenquads/), and I got to meet a bunch of people from the Combinatorics field in the Northeast,
as well as see my professor give a talk!
- I also got to hear our group talk about problems on their minds, such as rebuilding compressed graphs using error correction, graph isomorphism-checking,
group state transfer, zero forcing sets and persistent homology, while learning about k-covers in set theory and Sidon sets.

## I forgot to mention
- I joined an [Extremal Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_graph_theory) group. Yeahhhhh. Or rather, I was invited. We meet before my Abstract Algebra class, and then have more discussions
on Wednesdays. So it looks like now I'm this Combinatorics/Graph Theory/ Number theory mathematical cryptography researcher now haha. Nice!

## Reading an article
- I was reading an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/edray-goins-black-mathematicians.html) that resonated a bit with my past. In it, someone commented that:
"As someone who has a PhD in mathematics, I have seen that the senior members of the community bend over backwards to help their favorite students,
but let the rest struggle." It continues, "As in most areas of life, the favorite students are not necessarily the smartest or the most hard-working.  
Usually, the favorite students are the most loyal, and the senior members of the community can trust that they will continue to push for their agenda"
- This is a reality of graduate school (and in the working world, too!). Because I grew up in a household that values meritocracy and transparency,
even though we haven't always experienced it, it's a value that we hold. And when I began graduate school, I foolishly believed that this would be,
as the pedagogical research institute that values only the merit of one's work (hahaha a lie), the way that things would be.
- Almost immediately, I was met with the fact that this is not so. However, rather than soaking up energy thinking about it (energy that you so 
*dearly* need to complete your degree!), over time, I learned that it's better to focus on what you *can* change, what you have impact on.
- Academia and research are rife with politics. There will be favourite schools, favourite labs, favourite professors, favourite students, and you will
lose your mind trying to figure out *why* or *how* this was decided, and by *whom*. It honestly has taken me a long time to realize it doesn't matter.
In fact, it's petty and pathetic that some are only able to get by with these mechanisms, and I have gained so much respect for those who have gone on
to succeed *in spite of* it.
- A friend of mine who is a superstar postdoc but was not a favourite in their lab during their PhD, told me that honestly, "the favourites" tend to struggle
more when they are faced with having to operate without their crutches, so it's better to be set up for independence as early as possible. It's a blessing in
disguise if you are not, and you should treat it as such. I say this as consolation to the 95% of you who are not the decided "favourites" of your labs, or
your institutions. Some days, it may make you want to throw things. Do like I did this week instead, and book a massage. Treat yourself and then get back
to the grind.
- It took me a long time to realize that if in your heart you love the work you are doing (and you should! Don't waste your life on grad school for something
you're not passionate about!), it doesn't matter. And even though it's taken me a while, I have to say that it bothers me less now.
- But man, did it take a while. I am one of those who cannot sit by and see it, and many times my frankness and sly wit has gotten me into trouble.
Queen of shade here. And I still *do* think it, but it matters less that I see favours passed around, while openly people speak of a meritocracy. 
I am wiser, but even better, I reserve my energy to be upset about it on other things. I use it on trying to open more doors for people who don't have
the benefit of favouritism, or nepotism to aid them, or a closed back door to an opportunity. By reserving my energy, I also realize why it's even 
*more* important for me to finish. If I let it get to me, they would have won. 
- Anyways, I have to study for a test now :)

## And that's it
