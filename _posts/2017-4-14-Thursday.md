## Today I learned:

- Starting to get a bit of intuition for Grothendieck. I particularly like this quote by Taylor Dupuy's Math Vlog:
"if you have a covering and you cover the covering, (that) the covers of the covering give you a covering" :)

- However, Zariski sites are a bit of a mystery. I'm learning

## Things to get done:

- See if prof opens up quiz so I can take it. C++, that is. 

- Continue with Matlab, programming for correctness. I'm already starting to see that it is positively affecting my
ability to fluently read mathematical notation, which is fantastic.

- Continue with Lab for C++ (ie Lab #3, due on the 18th)


## Other notes: 

- Today I meet up with my Mathematician/ numerical computation friend. He usually helps with my understanding, so it's good to come to him with questions.
