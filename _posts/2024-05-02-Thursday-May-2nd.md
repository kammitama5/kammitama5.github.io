## A lot of Guacamole, and Making Lemonade

## Okay, so the heading is intentional...
- Today was...a bit different. The night before, I had a pretty full day! One of my friends from years ago (who is basically
my family) went all the way to Altadena to buy really good Indian food during lunch and then set up an entire picnic on the
Caltech campus! We chatted for the entirety of lunch, and it was just really wonderful.
- This year she was able to work quite a few days, which was great to hear, and she may also be visiting me in NorCal!
So that's super exciting! Unfortunately, I learned that one of her friends, who I met, [passed](https://iatse.net/remembering-j-c-spike-osorio-local-728/) [away](https://www.gofundme.com/f/juan-spike-osorio-wu). We met at NASA
years ago, during JPL's Open House. The saddest part was that it was while he was working on a movie set of a rather
big-budget tv-show. So I guess the unions have to figure all that stuff out and liability, etc. It was tragic and
senseless, but I'm making a note of it here to remember (February 6th, 2024). I don't want his death to be in vain.
- I then met up with my other friend who I worked with years ago, in Glendale of all places, and I took the bus to get there.
Apparently, five years later and it's literally only 25 cents more in terms of price. That shocked even me!
He showed me photos of some work he did in Idaho of all places, and we chatted until it was time for us to go. It was
quite wonderful! For every person, we said we would do it again sometime!
- Today, I met up with an entire family during lunch time, and we chatted, and they even gave me a ride to get a new
laptop AC plug! It was so great catching up with everyone; they're all wonderful people and it has felt like no time
has passed since we last met up. One of my friends said "you look the same! Just a little bit older" LOL.

## Guacamole and Lemonade
- The workshop has been good so far; this Google guy who apparently was advised by Shor and this other pqc person
whose work I know gave talks. So that was great. In the afternoons, we've been voting on topics and working on them,
and I had stayed with this one group for all four days because I wanted to commit to a project and hopefully
make some solid progress as a group. They all seemed pretty nice, even though there seemed to be a bit of overlap
with some work, as in, they seemed to know each other's work and say things that indicated that they might have
worked together in the past or known each other's work. I don't know if it's just me, but why do people just
do the thing where they stick together at these things? Weird. Anyways, they were nice, regardless.
- My advisor wasn't feeling the best, so she left a bit before lunch, and I stayed for the afternoon session.
- Strangely, though, I noticed a group that wasn't particularly large (in terms of interest and voting
over the past few days) become the "largest" group, with the most
interest today, but I figured who cares; I'm going to stay with my group. Then, I found out that they were writing
a paper, and that was a bit frustrating on a personal level, because I felt like I was not in the "in group" that
somehow knew that this was going to happen.  They claimed that it was just
that "two groups came together" and were writing a paper, but idk. There was never indication before today of that,
and on average, each group had about 4 people, with my advisor's group originally having the largest group of people,
which then whittled down yesterday to about 3 (and they spent a short time yesterday and then went to other groups;
she went to ours yesterday).
I guess I knew then why the group suddenly "had so much interest"
for the afternoon session, as a group of about four people suddenly became ten, so they were added and could
contribute to the Overleaf.
- I think after that, I just sort of bailed once I found out. I started texting my advisor. "It's so unfair", I said.
"I've felt like I've had to work for every single paper, and again, I am not in the cool crowd that somehow found out
a paper was being written among all the suggested projects, and they (the group writing the paper) are presenting their results tomorrow. I think I'm just not going to go tomorrow".
Honestly, on the way home, tears started streaming down my face. It felt like a set-up, I said, and it's not like
any of them really "need" a paper. It's not like it's going to help their career, I said angrily.
- I was consoled. "That happened to me, too, as a grad student. It's okay. You're figuring out who is and who is not
'your people'".
- I think after that experience, I just said what the heck and decided to have dinner instead, and vowed to do laundry
in the morning, and the day before my last in LA. These people were going to fly back to wherever, anyways, Who cares.

## It's definitely been a learning experience
- Sometimes I think a lot about how much it is expected of me to "bring my perspective", to be the person who "gives"
in academia, while I consistently get nothing back. I am going to an entire workshop next week at a conference where
literally hundreds of people have gotten papers out of our creating a workshop. It's also not been lost on me that the
numbers will slowly uptick as yet another way people who already have access will use this as yet another "rich get
richer" scheme for publications, but I'm too busy taking care of my own career to make a big deal about it.
- I have never published in that workshop, so it's yet another avenue where I "give", and get nothing back. Instead,
every paper, every opportunity, has been something I have had to claw my way through, while being doubted the entire
way. I am involved in quite a few projects, and I've never had that experience (yet) of just "being in the right place
at the right time" and getting listed as an author, but I've heard of countless others who have.
- I was thinking about the benefit of the doubt today, while I was trying to console myself on the walk back to the hotel,
and how someone even mentioned a paper I co-authored, but they literally called it "most famous person on the paper"'s
work. Like seriously, what the heck? Am I just the drummer!? It reminded me of that part in the movie, "Almost Famous",
in which the band members are pissed off by the fact that their faces are not included in the t-shirt / merchandise
for the band; only the lead guitarist's ([Russell's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OPp0MyQfoM)) is (see the clip "The T-shirt is everything"). Even when you do things that lead to credibility, you aren't even
acknowledged; only the people who already have it are.
- They were discussing it and I thought well, I could say something, but then I sort of mumbled something like "whatever,
I'm going to stay out of that", as they surmised various things about the work, and then I added a little context to
what was actually done on the paper. It's literally the only time I've been in a space where people suddenly started
talking about work I did, but the paper has zero citations (yet). And oh yeah, it's still "famous person's" paper.
You know, it's like a boat they own on a dock or something. I just day sailed with them that one time...or something (lol).

## Anyways
- I have a good sense of humour about it after having had an amazing dinner with my advisor, and spending the evening
getting some bags so I don't have to check-in bags for my next couple of trips.
- Seriously, though, I hope all academics aren't so tone deaf. It's not a feature, and while I *do* want it to be
better, I've been thinking a lot about the fact that maybe some systems are really by design; they're meant to bleed
the good-will out of people, expel people who are "too giving" like garbage, and contain the sociopaths who move through systems without
having to think about how their actions might affect others. There they are; these are the teachers of the future that we
are graduating, the people who will lead the world in research in the future. I hope you are happy with your choices,
academia (lol).
