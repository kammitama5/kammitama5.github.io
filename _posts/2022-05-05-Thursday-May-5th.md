## Privacy Law Talk on Fertility Apps

## I saw that there was some buzz about this
- Coincidentally, a year ago, I was working on a potential paper on Privacy apps, to be submitted to [CHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Human_Factors_in_Computing_Systems).
- This was work done in a class that was a hybrid class between CS and the Law department, and I gave a presentation on this in May 2021.
- Unfortunately, I am not really interested in pursuing this work anymore (I would prefer to not pursue research in fairness and privacy at the moment, in favour of mathematical cryptography research, which is my true love and I'm very happy pursuing a career in!), so I thought I'd include slides I gave to the 2021 class in the hope that it might be helpful to someone pursuing this work. These are not all of my slides; some are confidential.
- The central idea was that the way "accuracy" is advertised is deceptive (as defined by law) to users and therefore can be deemed unfair.
