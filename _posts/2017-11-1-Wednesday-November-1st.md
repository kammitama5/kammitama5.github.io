## Chugging Along...

## Got to sleep around 2:30am

- So, I went to sleep around 2:25am.
- But, Good news! I finished my Nanodegree project!
- I even amended the code after my review and 
  did a mini-course on Markdown.
- The linter (PEP8) was challenging, but very much
  appreciated. I made the mistake of going between
  two text editors (Sublime and Notepad++), and one
  of them didn't have proper settings for tabs and spaces.
  That resulted in my having to spend some time going through
  linter errors. Yikes!
  
## Interview

- Yesterday, I had an online (via Skype) interview.
- It was actually really enjoyable. I really liked the
  engineers and the company. 
- It's smaller compared to the companies I've been 
  recruited by, and it's local, but I actually think
  if they're generous enough to have me for an internship,
  I'd be pretty much over the moon about it. Plus, they're
  also FP-junkies!
  
## Opportunity to Mentor others

- I also received an opportunity to mentor others. 
  I was encouraged to do so, and I'd be thrilled to do that, also.
  
- I'm looking forward to my Nanodegree in Front End Web Development.
- Particularly learning some JQuery and JavaScript

## Registration

- I signed up for two classes for Spring : 
  - The first is a Concepts of Programming class, which covers some FP
  - The second is a Java course, taught by a professor who works at NASA!
    I've been thinking about state since Saturday, when we did our mob-coding.
    It's not something I've thought much about, since I've been thinking more 
    about FP.
  
## Starting Game Final Project

- I installed SFML today. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!
- Here is the installation success screen!

- I'm going to start from tomorrow understanding how I can make 
  windows and tiles and stuff for my simple game. 
  
- I already have an idea for my simple game

## Things to do

- Daily Hackerrank challenge (done). 
  (I even snuck in a CodeWars challenge, too!)
  
- Final Project (started, on course/ schedule)

- Get Certificate for Initial Nanodegree (working on)

## Upcoming

- I have class tonight, but that's about it.
  I'm pretty much just working on C++ (final project
  mostly) until my Nanodegree starts on the 6th.
  I'm guessing I'll start digging into JavaScript and
  JQuery then.
