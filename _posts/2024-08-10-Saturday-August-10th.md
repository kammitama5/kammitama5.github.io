## At another Quantum Summer School!

## I made it
- I'm not thrilled to be back on the East Coast, but at least I am not anywhere near campus. I'm instead in
Rhode Island, attending a summer school on quantum simulation. It's not exactly my home-home in terms of
research interest (since I focus on post-quantum cryptography), but it is important for the context of
the work I do. So I'd say it's more a community with which I have *some* overlap. Meanwhile, I do have
quite a few friends working in the area, for whom it is their home, so that's been really informative.
- The journey from SF was interesting; I was able to get everything into two checked bags (both the size of carry-ons)
and carried just a backpack on-board. There was news about a hurricane (Debbie), which is very much a
"welcome back" vibe. And of course, the food (or lack, thereof of options). Welcome back, indeed.
- I'm finishing up work for some projects, applications, and setting up my schedule for the semester. I'm starting
to refocus on the fact that I'm no longer just working on an intern project.

## Summer School
- The summer school has been pretty great. It began with a talks on neural atoms and then later on
talks on ion trap / crystal lattices. Even though I was already familiar with the neural atoms stuff,
because one of the co-authors had given some talks at Simons, it was still super enjoyable. And especially
when he started talking about some of the error-correcting codes stuff; I was riveted completely.
- Jetlag and travel fatigue began to set in later in the day, but we did have dinner, and then a networking
and ice-cream social, and we also took a photo for people who attended the school. I made friends with a
researcher in quantum chemistry who was absolutely thrilled when she learned where I was from, and a group of
us ended up chatting about what we work on until around minutes to 11pm. It's really interesting because
the generality of what we do (in terms of field) is similar, but there is such a breadth of what everyone
is working on. And everyone is super passionate about what they work on and will talk your ear off about it.
People travelled as far as South Korea and Oxford, and it's been a good, friendly group. 
- I think especially after this summer, I'm pretty comfortable within the area I am working. I enjoy it,
I like chatting with people about it, and I can listen and ask questions about what others work out and I
don't feel any FOMO; I'm pretty happy with my current focus and it gives me the space to also learn more about
quantum in a way that is not superficial, but also not a super steep learning curve (because osmosis is happening
over time, as I gain depth in my area of research as it relates to quantum).

## Thinking
- Something has been drifting around in my head from time to time. I met a researcher over summer who
mentioned that they thought I was one of the most resilient people they had ever met, and they said something
to me that I realized is just true. They basically said that someone who was supposed to have my back
"didn't believe in me". I realized it was true, but it felt strangely liberating. I felt like, understanding
that reality now, I don't care as much about that, and accept it as a fact. I can move on with the understanding
that they will never bat for me, and so my eggs will not be in that basket, and that's okay.
- I think before that moment of maturity, I would have been exasperated. What does it take to get them to *see*?
How could they be so blind, so ignorant? Everything has proven them wrong. Now, I think I feel less of that need
to care. Seniors may have more experience, but that doesn't mean they can't get it really, really wrong.
If academia has taught me one thing, it has taught me that. Even in the face of statements that disprove their
beliefs, academics can and do, in fact, double down. Especially if statements (however true) are said by people
they don't hold any trust or belief in; people who think they are unworthy. I think that enough time has passed
that if this person thinks I am "unworthy", I will likely never be (worthy) in their eyes, and they will never truly
support me.
Every opportunity I earn then becomes something that I "didn't really earn", and therefore must be given to others,
or isn't worth much / can be diminished.
So it is what it is. I can move on and protect myself emotionally with respect to that.

## A friend
- I have a really good friend at this workshop, who I met last year, who told me that he complains about something
once, and then he tries to forget about it or ignore people. I think that can actually be a healthy way of
purging and existing within academia, the longer I am in this space. Someone over summer told me that
academia can really be a sort of a "safe-space" for bullies. It does reward that kind of behavior especially if
one can perform well in other areas that are measurable, and if you are someone
over whom a bully has power, you have little to no recourse, so to have longevity, one often has to find ways
of dealing with things that can be frustrating.
- Still, that realization that there is nothing I can do to win someone over who never believed in me is really
just super liberating. It reminded me of a conversation a group was having about bias in interviews. There are
interviews one can go to where you can step into a room and know that there is no way, regardless of how you
perform, that you will get the gig. There are scenarios where you are brought in to justify an expectation that
you are there to fail, and that you should have never even been given the opportunity. So upon that realization,
figuring out how you deal with that is super important. Also, focusing one's energy on minimizing one's
interactions in spaces where you have no support is such a good way of taking care of oneself.
At the end of the day, if you make it out, but every part of you is broken, was it really worth it?
- If you struggle to work in an area where no one wants you to succeed, or believes you shouldn't even be there,
is it still worth pursuing?
- Anyways, I guess I should, for now, enjoy this space where people listen to what I work on, where they want
me to be there, at least for the while that I am here.
- It's been really interesting this year; I've finally gotten some feedback from people who have said they have
read and like my work, and care about the stuff I am working on, and that's been really validating. And surprising,
I guess.
So I guess now I'm just going to continue working on the stuff I'm enjoying working on, and 
with people who are willing to help me and support me along in my journey.

## And that's it.
