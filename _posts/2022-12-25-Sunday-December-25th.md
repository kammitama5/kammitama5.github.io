## Matroids Wk 1

## Topics
- I'm self-learning Matroids over break. I am also sitting in occasionally on a class this upcoming Spring, but I won't be able to make it
for all, as I'm involved in a couple workshops and research that precludes my attending all (e.g. I'm out of town for three weeks so far
for Spring). 
- I'm following Oxley's book, and watching the videos by Federico (currently on lecture 15). Primarily, once I get through the lectures
(which should be in the next seven days or so), I can dig into the meat of the book. I started the book, to read concurrently, but it 
does take a lot longer to dig through, as it's a lot denser to take in.
- I've also listed the papers I read this week related to that. The corrections are also really funny; my Notes app kept trying to correct
"Gammoids" to be "Gammons", so if you see weird stuff like that, please ignore it :)
- This week:
  - matroids and bases
  - Dependent vs Independent Sets (some recap from class)
  - laws of matroids, circuits, 
  - Jordan Curve Thm
  - Circuit Elimination Axiom
  - Base Complement
  - Rank stuff (mostly recap from class)
  - Duality / Dual of Matroids
  - Kirchhoff's Thm
  - Gammoids and strict Gammoids (co-transversal matroids) and submodularity

## Reading Resources
- Whitney’s 1935 paper, “On the Abstract Properties of Linear Dependence”.
- “A non-constructive proof of the four colour theorem”
- “Counting rooted maps by genus I, II and III” (3 papers in all)
- “Gammoids and Transversal Matroids” by Ingleton and Piff 
- Ardija’s “Traversal and cotransversal matroids via the Lindström lemma”
- Bruhn et al’s “Axioms for Infinite Matroids”
- JH Mason’s “On a Class of Matroids Arising from Paths in Graphs” (thanks for this, Graph Theory prof :)

- It's Christmas, so just sneaking a bit of time before we start opening presents and all of that. I literally smell of dog right now, as one of them
(aka the "trickster") was licking my feet this morning, randomly, and nestling on my chest. Amazing.

## And that's it
