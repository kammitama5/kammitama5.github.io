## Julia Graphing Problems

## Yeah
- You know when you are learning a language for the *first* time, and you are really, 
  really loving it, and then something just *doesn't work*? Yeah..that's me today.
  It's actually not as frustrating because I like the language, so no biggie. 
  
## Fitting Two Curves
- I'm matching data to a curve. Specifically, the curve is a quadratic one that has to match
  some data I plotted.
  
## So this is what I did so far

- I imported the data and split the two columns into two arrays (x and y)
- I did this by looking at the data file and creating two arrays, then
  pushing each array via an if else statement based on the number of values.
  Not the most efficient, I know, but it did the trick.
 
- Then I checked to ensure the two arrays were what I expected

- So far, so good!

- I plotted this data, x against y. I initially used Gadfly, but 
  decided to just use Plotly in the end, as it was recommended (I *do* like Gadfly, though!)

- Then I made a function as defined that is quadratic. This will be the function Curve
  that is plotted that fits the data

- This is an example of the function plotted. By manipulating the values of the quadratic
  equation, namely ```a```, ```b``` and ```c```, I can get it to closely fit a curve.
  
## But...

- I've been getting a browser error, (Something about JS Browser error), or otherwise
  I've been restarting Jupyter to get my kernels to restart. So we'll see..working on it.

## Also
- working on this assignment and finishing up my Types Honors assignment. Hopefully this week!
- Also SQL Nanodegree work and the first two assignments, to be completed in these upcoming two weeks,
  so I'll have Feb to do assignments 3 and 4. 
- I also got a 5 star rating on my Mentoring of peers (they have to rate you!). Pretty neat :D

## PLDI
- I reached out to the organizers. I'd really like to attend and help out as a student volunteer.
  I've also never been in Philly before :D

## And, that's about it!
