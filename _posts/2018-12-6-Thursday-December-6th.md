## Haskell and Forgiveness

## My blog's been pretty personal lately

- That's okay. I've been spending time coding, but I don't feel the need to write everything
  down right now. I have the rest of my life to write technical posts and sound like I know amazing
  things in Haskell. This is sort of an opportunity for me to note things along the way.
  I want to be able to read this blog years from now. I enjoy reading old letters and emails.
  
## I've been thinking about forgiveness a lot

- Both my parents are seriously amazing, but my dad talks about some of his relationships and how he struggled
  with a few very close ones in which he was treated badly. He said, it embittered him for years until he
  realized that he had to forgive those people, even if they would never apologize. He had to do it for himself.
  I have been thinking about that this week, particularly within the Haskell community, and in other instances
  in my own life. 
  
- SPJ made a post about CoCs and treating each other with respect today. I've had some really sour experiences
  in the Haskell community, but I've kept going. I want to believe that in an ideal universe, some of these 
  people will come around (maybe when they become parents), and will suck it up and say "you know, that was 
  really immature of me. I'm sorry". But I have to accept that it may never happen. It's been a tough pill for
  me to swallow, because I often want people to do the right thing. 
  
- Similarly, I've been thinking about some of my own experiences before this current path. In high school, I 
  wrote up an article for a Languages major (our school was weird and was divided into Sciences, Business and 
  Languages) and I didn't know the word "juxtaposed". She looked at me and said "let me guess, Science major, right?".
  It hurt, but I was also curious to find out what I was lacking. So I didn't do engineering in college. 
  Somehow, after college, I found engineering again. But once again, I found myself in an environment where one
  embittered engineer once told me that I would never become one, and that no one would ever hire me. Somehow,
  I had to find a way to forgive him, as I knew he was projecting. If I were a different person, it would not 
  have been so easy.
  
## And so

- The last instance of "forgiveness" I've been thinking about is forgiveness for myself, for feeling like I don't
  deserve any of the good things that have been coming my way. I was in a rut previously, where I would try 
  *really* hard, and just have the worst luck. Tech has been different for me. People want to help me, and I feel
  like there is a positive relationship between the work I put in and the level of fulfillment I experience, and 
  my level of competence. 

- I attended a Haskell Meetup on Tuesday night locally where I really struggled. And all of a sudden, all the 
  feelings of inferiority came back. I've also been doing "Book of Types", which is no walk in the park, and reading
  code so I can contribute to an open source project in the near future (I have to study for exams and sit my test
  this upcoming Monday, first, though!). This is what I mean by "forgiveness for myself". I want to get better 
  at telling myself it's okay to keep failing and getting better, especially as I came from an educational system
  where the price for failing was significant (different path/ different school system). Somehow, Haskell makes it okay,
  because (as I was telling my friend), it's like a conversation when I work with the compiler. 
  
## That's pretty much about it

- I have a bunch of homework to do, and I have to study for my test. Hopefully afterwards, I will be doing just 
  the work for the open source project, prepping for the summer internship and finishing up the Types book.
  Also, starting Little Typer and Mathematics for Programmers.
