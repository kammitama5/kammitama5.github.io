## 5/12/17 - Weekend of Homework


## Backtracking

- One of the things I have to do this weekend is implement backtracking in C++.
  So we'll see. I'm planning to use Vectors. 
  So far, so good. 
  
- When I get better, I'd like to implement it using function templates.
  I believe that my implementation is for an 8 x 8 board.
  
  I made a little diagram to help explain what I have to do, essentially.
  You can read up on backtracking [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)

## Heads up

- Today, I applied for a scholarship that will help me continue learning.
  Fingers crossed :) 
- Also, I'll probably be working throughout the weekend, so this may turn 
  into a Friday-Sunday (maybe even Monday!) post, even though it's marked
  "Friday", pretty much. 
  
## TIL

- [State space Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_search).
  I can use this to manually solve the rows and columns, 
  but it does not account for diagonals.
  
## Plan is

- Quiz tonight (due 5/15)
- Lab this weekend (due 5/15)
- Homework from Monday to Wed (due 5/18)
- Board sometime...(due 5/22)
