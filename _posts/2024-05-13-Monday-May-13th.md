## Formalizing Maths in Bonn

## I made it in yesterday
- I made it in yesterday to a workshop in Bonn at Hausdorff. It's about formalizing Mathematics, and I am super excited!
- It's been a really friendly group of people including Mathematicians, Formal Methods people, and even some people with
backgrounds in Law and Philosophical logic / ontologies, etc. I'm really enjoying it and Bonn so far.
- It's been really easy to just go out with a large group, or a small group (or anything in-between, really) for lunch,
to strike up a conversation, and today we had a special "beer and pretzels" Happy Hour. I walked with two new friends
to the Rhine and passed by Beethoven's place, as he is all over Bonn. I joked that we (Beethoven and myself) are friends
because we share the same hairstyle.
- We almost ran into a protest, and even though the police were there, it was peaceful. I also saw some people playing
football, and a group playing guitar and singing on the grassy lawn of the Botanical Gardens. And yes, today I had both
Vietnamese for lunch with a new friend, and in the evening, Spragel, as it is spragel-season!

## Formalizing Maths
- I reconnected with people who remembered me from the IPAM workshop, as well as the Arizona Winter school and other places
like that. I originally came for Lean, but ended up learning sTEX and Naproche instead because they are LaTeX-based and
seem more expressive than the typical proof assistant, and I really liked that. So tomorrow, I will try to formalize
some Maths with them. Today was just about installing software tooling, which I was able to do by the end of the day.
