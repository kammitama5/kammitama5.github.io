## Explorer 1 : 60 years later

## Hello from JPL!
- I made it to the Explorer 1 lecture! :D

- Actually, we firstly went to eat some dumplings, and chatted about 
  the Algorithm W, which I was unfamiliar with until today. 
  I mean, I've heard of [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system), but right now there are chunks
  that I understand, and some things I don't know that I don't know.
  But it's fascinating. 
- There was a lively chat about Data from Satellites, Data Visualization and Explorer 1.

## I also wandered around
- And took some photos of some new additions to the Exhibit at Von Karman.
These guys!

## It was a really fun night!
- Oh, and during the day, I managed to get Julia installed off-line and run on
  a notebook, but ```Plotly``` is giving me some issues. So I have to resolve those.
- But so far, so good. I should be able to resolve some plot issues online as well. 
  Hopefully.
- This weekend is Sparklecon, and then I settle down to do some of my Nanodegree assignments
  (hopefully two in the next two weeks). 
- And of course, there is sailing (and living on a boat) on Thursday through Sunday! :D
