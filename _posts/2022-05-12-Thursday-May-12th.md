## Happy Women in Mathematics Day!

## Yes, it's that time!
- It's this day because of Mathematician [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani), a [Fields Medalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal).
- I have not been always been given the privilege to study Mathematics at the graduate level, but even before I did, I knew of her because of having
read about her, and seen her impact in places like [MSRI](https://www.msri.org/web/cms), which I still agree (will fight anyone who disagrees on?) is the Maths utopia (at least) of the West Coast.
- Outside of the Programming Languages Research Academic community (which is quite wonderful and supportive), MSRI was one of the first grad school, 
academic communities to also welcome me with open arms. So it's little wonder that I ended back there today, in a virtual seminar celebrating the day,
and also attending a session on "How to do Research". I met a bunch of Mathematicians, including ones who do interesting things like Quantum Algebra,
and of course, Combinatorics (specifically, Matroid Theory). And interestingly, some of them started out just like me; I met someone who had a past career in Mechanical engineering,
for example. It was really fun! I had to leave early, however, because I have been working on a research project since this Monday.
- But this was not before asking yet another professor if I could sit in on their Graph Theory course in Fall, because if I could take all the Pure Maths
classes, I definitely would! :) And the answer was yes!
- I've been reading a lot, and writing proofs for a research project I'm working on that started this Monday (but that I have been musing about since March). I'm enjoying it thoroughly, and it can only be described as an "unlearning" of academic habits, and
the equivalent of joining a pirate band of researchers. And it's just as fun as it sounds!

## Why did this happen?
- I've been hanging around a bunch of different persons at various stages in their careers, and I've begun to realize that:
  - I love research, so why should I let an institutional structure prevent me from doing what I love?
  - I can find a way to do research that isn't at the mercy of the traditional academic system
  - As much as I've been learning *how* do to research, I can rethink *why* I do research and *how* to publish and *who* to publish with (sorry I ended with a preposition, English professor!)
  
## Enter Pirate Researchers
 - In spaces like Mathematics, Crypto, the Social Sciences, etc, it's very typical to find collaborators in the most unlikely places. A friend of mine
 had said that he wasn't sure he cared for Academia, was rejected by some of the most immediate academic structures, went off to his community and worked
 for a bit in that doing research, and came back to those very institutions falling all over themselves to hire him. So he made his own way, and was able to renegotiate
 from a position of leverage / power.
 - In my first year, I was working with a student in Computer Science (CS) and Economics, and an Economics professor. In fact,
 in the entirety of my career, I've preferred to work with people I just work well with, which has usually been with a range of skills. 
 For example, in theatre, I did lighting design, but I would have to work with a director, a stage manager, a sound engineer, etc. Similarly,
 in film, I would have to work with (if I were working in the camera department), sound, grips, electric, location managers, assistant director,
 art director, etc. You're working towards a common goal, pretty much, and each one is contributing based on skills that they are experts in.
 - I was also writing pretty regularly with a group based in New York City that included researchers in Art History, Fine Art, Literature, etc.
 - And for my stint in robotics, I would have to work with engineers who enjoyed mechanical or electrical, and contribute with coding.
 - I think research is *teachable*. It's a skill that you exercise the muscle of. It reminds me a bit of that part in King Richard (the movie that you
 should definitely see), where a coach tells the Williams sisters' father, Richard (who the movie pays an homage to), that it's too technical a sport for his daughters to learn. But they do 
 it anyway. Granted, they *are* prodigious, but the point is that something like research is not outside of the reach of anyone who really wants to
 pursue it. Institutionally, we put up these walls that are exemplified by a lack of support, while not having those for others, which results in the 
 *perception* that some people are able to learn research, and others cannot. Of course, by all means, if you don't *enjoy* it, that's something else
 (and of course the more you do it, like anything else in life, the better you get at honing your skills),
 but I don't think, for anyone who has a passion for it, there should be obstructions for the opportunity to at least *try* to see if you like it.
 - So anyways, in my first meeting with my current mentor, his biggest hesitation about me was actually that I might be *too academic* about it. 
 - I hilariously started our conversation by [nerd-sniping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd_sniping) him, which made both of us burst into laughter. But fortunately,
 academia hasn't come easily for me, in that I have had to hack my way in, and am not a typical student. I am well steeped in the space, so there are
 definitely ways that I think and operate that I do have to be flexible about and unlearn, but I am excited to do this. I am committed to running away
 and joining the circus...to follow my dreams. There might be anti-canonical-bespoke unicorns!
 
## I have never been happier
 - I had an amazing week! I met my research friends, I made friends with a group of over 80 people, I received Kudos from my ICLR group of newly-minted
 researchers (who I am quite excited to see as regularly as I can, as well as their progress in research), I participated in an interview, a podcast,
 went out for pizza with Pure Maths friends and heard the table erupt into talking about sheaves and cohomology, I saw pioneer [Ted Nelson](https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/?chapter=chapter2_64) at Stanford
 speak about his inventions (such as [ZigZag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigZag_(software)) and [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu)), and about how he fondly remembered [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart)
 and I went out for ice-cream with a friend.
 - I had a conversation this week about how I *love* hearing about these inventions that aren't quite in the spotlight anymore. I think to do research,
 you should understand the genealogy of your field. So for programming languages, learn about COBOL, Algol, Sisal, Lisp, etc. Attend [HOPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages_(conference)).
 One of the things I have enjoyed about the Pure Mathematics field that I was not quite getting from ML (that's Machine Learning, not Meta-Learning) was that
 they regularly look at papers with good ideas and do not just focus on recent work. They work on problems that are a century old, that are interesting.
 I think that's cool.
 - As a researcher, one of the earliest things I learned was from a professor
 who has such a depth of understanding of the history of his field that he reguarly came up with ideas that were mind-blowing, which he confessed were
 thinking deeply about paradigms of the past that other researchers had lost an interest in (or did not know about). We focus so much on the new,
 the inventions or research that are the most influential, that we miss that there are so many great inventions or ideas in research papers considered
 to be not as influential, or in inventions that were "failures". And part of the joy of doing research is getting to (re-)discover those things, to revive
 beautiful ideas, regardless of their era. Maybe some of these ideas were revolutionary, but were just not proposed at the right time; the world was not quite ready to listen. Perhaps *this* is the 
 right time, and *you* are that person to re-introduce this generation to those perspectives and ideas. So anyways, I used to hang around the [Computer
 History Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_History_Museum) [quite a bit when I lived on the West Coast](https://kammitama5.github.io/Thursday-May-18th/), and I love so much hearing about ideas from the history of Computing. I think it's awesome.
 When you look at the gaps in time between important inventions, it's mind-blowing to see how creative and different the ideas were, and how persons tried to think about these problems that had not been solved yet.
 - So on we go. [Helms-Alee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_helm)!
 
## And that's it.
