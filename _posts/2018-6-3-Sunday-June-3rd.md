## GSoC and RustReach Day 21 and Lambda Conf Workshop

## Pre-Conf
- This was the first day of LambdaConf. The first presentation was by Paul. 
  Paul was a part of my local Haskell group, and I know him quite well, so it was
  really cool to see him again at LambdaConf.

## Typed FP on the Job: Why bother

- Algebra on Type
- A monad is: function that can possibly have an effect into a value
- make everything a value
- failure is a value so you have control over it
- algebraic property: total function
- "log failures of a Monadic function" taken from Reason (article)
- know what code does before it runs as a developer
- as a business, economically worthwhile

## Tony's Hop workshop : FP Data61 Course
- I really really enjoyed this workshop.
- defined w/ prefix ```h 55 88``` vs infix ```55 `h` 88```
