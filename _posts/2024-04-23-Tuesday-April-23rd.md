## USTARS and IOWA CITY

## It is super early
- I'm actually writing this after working on a paper submission, just before heading to sleep. It's been a week!
- I just got back from presenting a poster at USTARS, which is the Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research
Symposium. It's my first time, it was in Iowa City, and I have to say it was AMAZING! You really felt pretty close with
everyone by the end of the Symposium. Also, my labmate Jeremy gave a Distinguished talk, which was awesome! We were both
plotting about whether or not we would make it this year, and I was convinced!
- On the last day, I ended up carpooling back with a shuttle of Californians (naturally). We plotted to have the next USTARS
in Oregon (nope; the next one is in Colgate U or Georgia).
- Anyways, so about Iowa City; the people are super friendly, the food I had was amazing, and I just had a great time.
There is so much to do, too! After the first day of the Symposium, people went to a bar, some others went to a house party,
and this was after a full day of talks and posters and a dinner afterwards, too! My friend and I (since she goes there)
ended up hanging out at her apartment and watching the movie Elemental, which I hadn't seen before. I just had a great time.
- There were so many people who were just amazing (including my roommate, who is a total bad@$$ and not only got the NSF award,
is mentored by two amazing profs but also happens to have Caribbean parents!) and it was just the most wonderful, thoughtful
space. I will upload all the photos I took for the organizers; I promise!
- Oh, we also took a group photo, as is customary!
- Interestingly, my friend at CMU had told me that they went to undergrad in Iowa, and it was a good time. So they had hoped
I would like it, and I definitely did! I loved it! I kid you not; by the first afternoon I had found boba and fish balls and
was having a pretty tough time deciding what to eat considering I really only had to eat one meal. And everyone was just
super friendly and I made friends with a corgi!
I even went to a prospective students Open House day that happened to be going on
when I arrived, and I pretended to be everything from a Theatre Arts student, to a Physics student, until I hung out at the
Maths table.
- The theme this year seemed to have some quantum-ness to it, so some talks on Hopf algebras, quantum algebras, Bosonization
but also some talks on more classical Graph Theory topics involving colorings and that sort of thing. And of course, on
the Algebra side, one of the Faculty distinguished talks was on the ABC Conjecture and my friend (yes, the one who I hung out
with to watch Elemental) gave a talk on Holomorphic Differentials to a pretty full room!
- I was surprised that there was a lot of interest in my poster, which I was sort of arguing about with Jeremy a while ago,
because I wasn't sure that I was a fit for the Symposium. I have to take the L on that one; he was right that it would get
a lot of interest. So that was really gratifying. In general, I think everything was super interesting, and every session
was well-attended.

- So good! Potato and veggies and salad with strawberries and I don't even know it all tasted delicious!

- Or even paper planes!

## Okay
- I think I'm definitely heading to sleep at this point!
- It's going to be an interesting set of weeks as I'll be travelling again, while working. I actually prefer that,
as I find that I'm much more productive outside of campus. I'm particularly excited for summer, interning, going to
Maths grad summer school (yay) and for the upcoming forum I'll be attending in Fall, as well as my first
visit to an institute I've been communicating with weekly in Spring! It's been a wonderful
year for me, and it's all been super exciting, but I need to sleep I think!

## And that's it
