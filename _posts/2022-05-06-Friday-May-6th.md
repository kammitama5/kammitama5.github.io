## Last week of classes and An Amazing week!

## Once again, I am busy
- But great news! My research proposal was accepted and I get an award for it, and get at least one publication out of it. Hooray!!!
- I also gave a Math talk! Look at such a nice compliment from an attendee!

- I'm doing a podcast this upcoming week, taking part in a research documentary, and have to follow up on some other tasks.
- This week was amazing! I ended up hanging out with Maths friends to get Jamaican patties, going to a grad school barbecue and sitting
with Pure Maths friends and talking about graph-coloring problems around a table (inevitably!) and basically just having a great time!
- I also started connecting more with summer people and plans, and I'm ecstatic. It's going to be a lot of fun!

## Things this week
- Ellliptic Curves: Moduli spaces, Fundamental Domain cont’d, Katz Mazur, Cartier Divisors, Gamma-5 problem, Scholie’s Theorem
- Number Theory: Pause Week: My prof said that Silverman would win in a maths between Yoda vs Silverman
- Algebra IV: Nakayama’s Lemma, Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, Adjugate Matrices, Kronecker delta, Summary of class and plan for Barbecue (!!).
