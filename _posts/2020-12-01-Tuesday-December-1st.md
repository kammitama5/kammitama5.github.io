## Things that you're bad at

## It's difficult to do things you're bad at
- When I was doing a lot more art stuff, I knew that my weaknesses were perspective and proportion.
  Both things, if you've taken training in art, require slowing down. 
- In particular, techniques such as sight-size, common at the [atelier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier), require you to step
  back, measure and draw a line, little bit by little bit. And to correct mistakes, and to try again. It requires a lot of patience
  because you are constantly comparing for accuracy between the line you made, and the reality of the thing you are drawing from.
- Similarly, when I was growing up, even though I drew a lot, my teacher had more graphics-design training and was good with colour,
  but our training in perspective was lacking. I discovered this very quickly by the time I took one or two art classes in college (my major
  was not fine arts, btw). 
- I liked "finishing" or adding details, but I needed to step back and work on the construction. The classes I took in LA when I was trying 
  to figure out what I wanted to become taught me a lot about construction lines, and how and why they're important. Somehow, my earlier 
  training hadn't taught me much, if anything, about structure and construction lines, the foundation for training. And that was frustrating.
  It had taught me how to finish, but not to start. It didn't have substance under the "shiny thing". It was shallow.
- One of the things my professor would make me do is start and work only on construction, and when I had gotten to the point where it was
  good enough for finishing, make me stop. It was a way of making me focus on things I wasn't particularly strong in.
  
## Code
- I think about how this translates to my understanding Computer Science, and in pursuing a PhD. I think we as engineers love to focus (and brag)
  about things we're good at, but it takes a certain humility to acknowledge that you suck in a thing, and that there is a long way to go.
- I think about that a lot especially during my life as a PhD student, because you're essentially doing just that. You're starting from the ground
  up to learn a thing, and you're very bad at it, and you fail over and over again. And you feel like crap. But one day, you become very good
  at the thing. You focus on a lot of starts. You get better at the starts.
- You spend time thinking deeply about a thing. When I was in Silicon Valley, I realized that something about that, and the process, was so 
  compelling to me; perhaps because it lined up so closely to the values I had learned great artists had.
- Great artists focus on the start, they focus on the things under the shallow, just like great researchers. 

## Anyways
- I started with sketching this sculpture and doing the comparison thing. I haven't done it in a while, but too many people were messaging me,
  so I turned off my phone and did some of this for a bit. Time to get back to code and reading.
