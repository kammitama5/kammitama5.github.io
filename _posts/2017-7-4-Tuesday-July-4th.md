## Happy 4th! With Mock-Ups and Sailing...

## Happy 4th! I stayed up last night...

- I stayed up to complete the lesson for Project 2 of the Nanodegree, 
  so I could focus on the actual Project for the next 10 days.
  
- Since that is done, I thought I should look at some possible topics
  and designs, as we can make our web page about pretty much anything.
  
- That being said, there *is* a rubric to follow.
  It basically must use:
  * three style rules in CSS
  * one class selector rule 
  * at least one image
  * 2 sections of content
  
## What am I interested in?

- I decided to make mine a small webpage on the Founcations of 
  Functional programming. Most of the content, though 
  interesting to me, is on some horrible webpages.
  
- So how about if I made mine pretty?

## That's a huge project, isn't it?

- Nope. Mine is just blurbs, touching on some topics. 
  They can seek out references if they want more information.
  
## Things I wanted to cover 

- I drew out a list of things and came out with about 14 elements.
  * Navbar/ Header
  * Profile with photo of Alonzo Church
  * Small bio
  * Category Theory header (column info)
  * Lambda Calculus header (column info)
  * Column Info detail (Category Theory)
  * Column Info detail (Lambda Calculus)
  * Curry-Howard Isomorphism header
  * Maybe an image of some LaTeX (optional)
  * Footnotes/ References header 
  * Footnotes detail to href links
  * Share this via fb or twitter (optional)
  
 ## Then...
 
 - Moved on to some mock-ups. I think I like 
   the second one, even though the margins aren't equal
   
 <img src="/images/drafts/firstdraft.png" width="500"> 
 
 
 <img src="/images/drafts/seconddraft.png" width="500"> 
 
 - So this should give me enough time to work on implementing these
   and getting feedback, etc.
 
 ## If I get cool Sailing pics...
 
 - I will also try to get cool sailing pics...we'll see.
   I'm in love with sailing. I hope that one day I can just 
   do it on my own.
