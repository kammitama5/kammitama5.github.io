## Quantum . Quantum weekend 2

## We went hiking and tried a giant slide!
- We get to go again on Wednesday! We did 3 to 4 miles on Jenni's Trail, then walked to the library for coffee
(Lucky Coffee) and then decided to walk back to try the Alpine Slide. It was so worth it and my first time
doing this kind of slide. I think after this I may want to become a Mathematics high school teacher, because that
group has all the fun! :)

- Riding up to start the Alpine slide. I've never been in one of these before,
which is hiliarious because I live in VT. But first time's a charm and I could
not have picked a better group!
