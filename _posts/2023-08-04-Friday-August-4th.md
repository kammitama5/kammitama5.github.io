## Last Day at Quantum Summer School

## Today was the last day
- I ended up getting back around 1am or something like that. We had the final lectures by Sandy, Bill and Jeongwan, foraged for black currants in
the morning on the way to Prospector, ate our last lunch meal together, then went to the Olympic Park to watch some freestyle jumps, I heard
there was this barbecue with 50 people, we hiked back from Olympic Park and then went stargazing. It was pretty epic and we ended up singing
"The Final Countdown" on the car ride back home, which was hilarious. It was such a fun time.

## Here are some photos
