## Dreams of Yesteryear and Today; the start of a new semester

## I started Spring semester this week
- So far, it's been amazing. I'm in love with all of my classes! I've already sat in on a Number Theory class and attended my first 
Random, Probabilistic Graphs class. I stayed up last night going over notes for our first class, reading about Ramsey Theory, and adding books
to my wishlist that I'd like to buy over time. 
- This semester, there are familiar classmates, and even a study group already forming for Real Analysis. So I'm stoked. 
- A part of me is still a little heartbroken from having left, but I get to go back again for Christmas (fingers crossed), and my friends are already
planning a trip with me then. So there are things to look forward to on multiple fronts.


## Rekindling a fire
- While I was home, a friend of mine hung out with me and we visited my high school, as we were in the area doing research for his thesis paper.
- As it turns out, the subject was someone we both knew, who had won multiple awards, but there was a dearth of information on the subject matter.
- Part of this lack of information was because in my country, especially in the Arts, there is a lack of archival processes. This is interesting because
when I first graduated high school, I worked on a local soap opera and met a producer from the show who asked me to work on a gig where I organized archives
(newspaper articles, etc) for the Trinidad Theatre Workshop's big move to a new space.
- When I first started my PhD, I began thinking about databases, and so for this particular problem, one of the issues is that even in our local libraries,
the database system and information retrieval is quite poor (not to mention, there is a general lack of data). My dad likes to say that we collect data 
or information, but we don't do anything with it, and that part of this issue stems from the colonial legacy whereby countries in our region obtained 
independence, but we at the local level were taught to be admininstrators and delegate to a higher power, which means that we have had to unlearn systematically
how to designate and begin to redesign our own systems.
- So anyways, I left with my friend fairly frustrated, because the persons at the libraries basically told us that even though this library was specifically
for local heritage information, it couldn't be of much help and that we should "use Google" within the library (again; the delegation to an outside entity).
And I began to think about knowledge discovery systems, because even the information and databases that we do have locally don't find structure or meaning
between the entities of the data that *do* exist within the databases. So that's something I think that would really be of value locally.
- Furthermore, there's a real divide between the technical and the Arts in my country, which is something I've always struggled with. The intersection of 
persons who really understand the needs of the Arts community and have technical skills is rare. If you are considered "gifted" intellectually within
school, you are steered away from the Arts, which means that technologically, there is a lack of persons who can help artists use things like software
to make systems that would really help their industry. So that's kind of a larger, interesting goal that might be something I can eventually contribute to,
or establish some kind of fund to make this happen to connect people with the skills to do that with artists who would benefit from these systems.
The really interesting intersection is my own; people who have had an exposure to the Arts, understand how it works locally *and* have technical skills.
And I was lucky because someone in my high school (a professor, perhaps) had the insight to let a handful of us pursue both Science and Art classes.
- But this isn't about the Arts; it's about people who are technical and can contribute to a domain-specific area, understanding what the people who use
those tools *need* rather than designing an out of the box piece of software that doesn't consider what they truly *need*. I've been thinking about that
a lot. My dad basically spent his entire career doing this (he's a huge database and data person, and is also super into open source; these days he's into
video recording and editing technology, which is funny because it means he has a bunch of questions for me about all kinds of random stuff).

## My high school
- The school is responsible for educating several engineers, doctors, lawyers, leaders in the Arts and educators.
- It also offered squash, netball, football, tennis, gymnastics, badminton, theatre, singing, swimming, and the eco-Activist's club. I might have, at some point
been involved in all of these. I was also in both the Christian club and the Indian Cultural Club, too, I think, and even made a drawing of Mother Lakshmi
one year for our yearly exhibit.

## This week
- I have a couple meetings but still feel a bit out of place. I'm still grappling with being back. The food from home is helping.
- I've also been doing yoga in the mornings during the week, which has been fantastic. My parents put me on to that.
- One of the things that is always a little startling coming back is the value of money. You become painfully aware of how much each dollar is worth
compared to back home, converting back and forth. And there is a bit of guilt in spending it, but in a few months I'm pretty sure I'll get back to
my usual grind.
- In yoga, one of the things the instructor talks about is "setting an intention" each day. I think for this week, my intention will be to continue
to be grounded, be aware of my health, sleep, and to take my time getting back to work here, as well as to be organized for this semester. 
- I have some anxiety about some parts of the year, but for now I'm trying to take each day and each week at a time.


## And that's it
