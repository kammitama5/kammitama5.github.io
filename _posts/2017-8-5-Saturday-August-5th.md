## Big Data Day 

- I attended Big Data Day briefly today.
  I'm still sick with the flu, so I was unable to stay too long.
  I left a little before 2pm. I was feeling light-headed.
  
- I did get a smoothie and some soup on the way home, along with
  an acai-bowl. So that helps. Now, I'm resting.
  
## Met some wonderful people, caught up with wonderful people

- I was able to hit up the booths and was pleasantly surprised.
  
- The first vendor flat out said out loud "You're a STUDENT!?
  You ask some really smart questions!"
  
- Another company flat out wanted to bring me on board. 
  I had some something and they said "woah woah woah..hold on...
  can we bring our head of Engineering over to talk to you?".
  At the end, the guy actually gave me a hug. Also, we have 
  quite a lot in common, and even contacts in common! So we'll see.
  
- I also met a Haskellino! Yeahhhh!!!! He suggested that when
  we don't have a speaker, we have a Category Theory meetup.
  I'm down with that. I have C++ class on Wednesdays, but am free
  otherwise. 
  
## So...

- I was advised by a good friend today that I don't need to 
  (esp since I *hate* it) do web dev stuff at all, and that I should
  kind of cut that stuff out. Fine by me. And just do data science
  projects and that sort of thing. Fine by me. I actually think 
  that's good advice. 
  
- I'm happy the Coding for Product workshop was free, and I did learn
  some stuff, but I honestly didn't enjoy it. She (the person leading)
  actually offered another project (which will be in JS) that we could
  work on as a team (upcoming), and I felt badly but I didn't respond
  as everyone else did, enthusiastically with a "yes". 
  
- I'd prefer to work on some Algorithmic knowledge, learn FP/ Category Theory,
  and projects in data science. Those are legit goals. 
  
- There is so much web dev material out there, I sometimes feel guilty 
  about not working on that stuff and not taking advantage of everything.
  But based on my feedback, I definitely am headed in the FP / data science
  direction. I've straight out been recruited for that stuff.
  
## I need to learn Scala

- Yes, that's what I need to do
- I also need to do a Tensorflow project
- The Cloud training is / was worthwhile (that stuff is ok)
- The C++ stuff is OK
- The FP / Category stuff is OK
- Algorithmic stuff is OK
- Proof theorem stuff (like Coq) is OK

## Conclusion

- You're on a good path, and you should trust your instincts.

- Don't feel guilty because you *hate* UI and web dev. You don't have to do it.

And...that's about it for now...
