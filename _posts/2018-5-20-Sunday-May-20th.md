## MarinaFest, GSoC and RustReach Day 7

## GSoC AM
- I went to sleep around 2:30am. I was really struggling with getting some code to type-check.
  Specifically, I really thought it was a Double, but I was able to get it to type-check by using
  a Bool value. I wonder if there's a way to print out or trace directly specific values? I really
  felt like I was floundering and there was a lot of disbelief in my ability to complete the task
  by myself. 
- *update* I turned out to be a ```precedence problem``` so I was able to use ```(0 :: Double)``` to get it to work.
   I would have never figured that one out on my own. Thanks to Chris on that one! So the code is now refactored and merged,
   and hopefully I'll be working on something new Monday AM.
- I was able to also able to move on to Rust Chapter 6. It's gotten steeper in terms of the learning curve.
  It's like everything has gotten steeper.
- I also have one assignment to complete for class, due on the 23rd. It's silly, but I should do it. Again,
  straight from the textbook.
  
## I got up at 5:30am
- Headed to volunteer at Marinafest. I haven't, as you may have noticed,  been sailing. Just because things have 
  been crazy, and programming is my first priority. I even had to turn down a race, but the captain likes me so 
  he told me I'm up for the next one. So we'll see. So I thought that this may make up for some of the time 
  I haven't been around. It was only for two hours or so, and everyone asked where I was and how I was, but well..life.

## I was so tired
- I fell asleep for the entirety of the 45 to an hour long train ride from Santa Monica to downtown LA.
  Completely knocked out. :/
- I guess I really want to push myself, but I also have a fair amount going on.

## Tonight
- I'll stay up and do some Rust and Haskell
- Hopefully also either do laundry tonight or tomorrow and pack for house-sitting Tuesday night/ Wednesday night.
  Basically, I'm collecting the keys tomorrow afternoon and heading over by my friend Tuesday evening, but I need
  my two laptops and clothes for work on Tuesday, so..yeah..organization. 
- It would be nice sometime to just have normal-time to myself. Kind of like "what did you do this weekend?" 
  "Oh nothing..just go out drinking with friends." Comfortable life, you know? Maybe one day.
