## Welcome Back, LA (Recap Goog SF)

- So I made the long journey to Google SF yesterday
  for an amazing event! 
  
- Not only did I get to meet the VP of Engineering for 
  Google Cloud (who quite liked my Cassini tshirt!),
  but I also got some GREAT advice on which departments
  may be a better fit for me. 
  So we shall see. 
  
- I also made some great friends and mentors. 
  I have a very positive impression of the company. 
  
 ## Udacity Mentorship (Update)
 
 - I struggled with the Internet, so I have some 
   catching up to do, but I now have a mentor
   named Christopher! 
   I'm really excited! 
   
## Here are some fun-time pics of my travels, and of the event....
