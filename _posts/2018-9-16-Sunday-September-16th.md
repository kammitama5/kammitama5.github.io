## Pushing for More

## The end of the weekend

- I worked through the weekend, doing Haskell and some other work. 
  I also had two interviews. During the week, I had to take a break and write some C++, also, for class.
  It's always surprising when I realize I remembered how to write some C++, because
  I haven't written a lot of it since the beginning of Summer. The sad part is that in class we use C++
  and Java, and I certainly don't remember how to write Java, so C++ it is.

- My friend and I continued studying during lunch times, and in fact, this past week
  we studied for three straight lunch-times (Tues/Wed/Thurs) and on Friday during lunch
  time we also hung out. We also managed to rope in two senior devs, which is really fun!
  One of them was already gushing about me, because we had met before and he was fascinated by
  what I was interested in. But he's been out of the office and returns this coming week, so I haven't
  really spoke to him since.
  
- One of the things she spoke about was the rift between testers and devs. It's really true. 
  It's bizarre to me because I very much consider myself a dev. I remember when I first started
  doing the internship, I met a guy who was a dev and asked him if he was ever a tester, and told
  him that I was doing this (just as a third internship for the experience; I was also doing two other
  dev internships) and he blandly said "that sucks" and ignored me. It's so unlike how I'm treated
  outside of working there. Just because someone has a label doesn't mean that's who they are.
  A lot of the testers there have been scooped up by pretty big companies (but as testers).
  The devs..not so much lol. But to each his own, I guess. So we were talking about how we just
  don't get what the deal is about the hate between testers and devs. It's real, though.
  It's nice to have that momentum and I really enjoy working with her during lunch, and just
  getting better.
  
- Interestingly, my C++ code is a lot cleaner than it was before summer. I've also found myself writing tests.
  It's nice to see the improvement. My friend laughed and told me that if a tester crosses into dev at the company,
  the testing head gives a $50 card to any tester who finds a bug in the dev's code LOL. That's pretty funny.
  I told her when she transitioned if I found it, I'd take her out to drinks or dinner with the card. :)
  
- I also made a bit of progress on the parser I'm working on via pair-programming today. So that
  was really great. I just want to continue and get better. In between, I've been watching the
  British tv series "Rich House, Poor House". It's quite good. I try to take breaks between
  working (usually timed) so I won't burn out, and it allows me to rest my eyes and not suffer from
  computer strain later on.
  
## I got into SPLASH
- But I don't think I can go. It's in Boston, which I've always wanted to visit, and one of the Haskell
  sessions is even in MIT, but I'd have to go through PAC Funding and miss a week of my internship,
  and I end up losing money because I wasn't able to get my hotel covered. That's my biggest cost,
  so maybe some other time. It would have been nice, though, because Nikos from Rust is going to be there,
  and the captain of the volunteering team (for which I was chosen) worked on the V8 engine. So it would 
  have been nice to talk to her about the internals of a browser, considering that I'd like to build one.
  But I guess the timing didn't work out. 
  
## My trip is confirmed for ICFP
- I'm definitely going to that. My hotel and flight is all booked, and I spoke to my roommate via email.
  My mentor from GSoC will also be there, along with a bunch of other people I know. It's going to be a lot
  of fun, but I'm sure it will also be tiring because it's going to be a *lot* of people between Strange Loop
  and ICFP. But I feel energized knowing I'll be around FP-ers again. There's even a Haskell Slack Channel (I also
  joined the Rust and Racket ones!) and people there are working Haskell jobs. That gives me a lot of hope.
  The more time I spend on this, the more I realize I just want to work in Haskell right now. I just spend my time
  on that. And I'd like to get better. 
  
## Grad school
- I'm sitting exams this week and writing up an SOP (again lol) but for feedback this time. I've had four professors
  already give me the OK for recommendations, so that's all good. So who knows, I guess. We'll see how it goes.
  I'd love to, if given the opportunity. It would be a great experience and opportunity for me and I'd grow so much.
  
## Anyways, I think that's about it
