## Roudy Reunion at AIM and Turtles

## What is a Roudy, and why would you be having a reunion?

- A Roudy is a participant of the Roots of Unity workshop, of which I was a participant last year.
Since then, it's spun off other similar conferences in applied mathematics. Roudy is short for
"Roots of Unity". I was one of 30 participants picked in the first cohort ever last year,
to be placed in the Arithmetic Geometry group. So we had a reunion this year at AIM, which
is the American Institute for Mathematics at Caltech.

## The Journey
- But first, Lincoln Nebraska...
