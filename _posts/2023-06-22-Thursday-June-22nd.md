## An Experiment!

## I'm blogging over the next two weeks
- So I'll be blogging some notes over the next two weeks here. Specifically, I'm a (1 of 4) participant(s) in a fellowship and I'd like to do a TIL for each day
I'm here to process things. I expect to be learning *a lot*. I expect to make a lot of mistakes, and I've heard that each day, we get a review, and there is also
a midpoint check-in, and a final check-in before we leave. I think it will be good for me looking back.
- It's something along the lines of "How do you think you did" and "what do you think worked?". I love that for this particular opportunity, they
encourage us to try new things and fail a lot with pedagogy. 
- I won't mention specific names of people, but just general "larger / big picture" thoughts in a sentence (or at most a couple sentences) each day.
- It will all be here, in this post, so I can use it to grow and become more thoughtful in my own journey.

## Some pre-advice
- I wanted to put some of this here as a reminder of some things I've heard from seniors who have a lot more experience. One of the most recent things
I have heard from one seminar I recently attended was "Put as much structure for the students who need it, and those who don’t will ignore it.".
Another word of advice I have heard from some of the professors guiding us is:
"Give adequate support. Give the benefit of the doubt; Reach in so the student doesn’t have to always reach out."
- Most recently, I've also been exposed to some methods I had never heard of before (even with a lot of coaching in the Grad Writing Centre at my university; Nancy did a great job with respect to that), so again, I'm learning a lot.
