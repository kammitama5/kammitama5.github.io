## Hello from ICLR!

## I am in Vienna, Austria!
- I have never felt jet-lagged, to be honest, but this time it HIT me. It is rough. I literally spent all day today sleeping
but I feel MUCH better now. It worked ou well, as we had the organizer reception today, which was wonderful!
- It definitely is a bit different from Kigali, I have to say. But the organizers have been quite wonderful, and I've met
a bunch of lovely people. It still feels very surreal; this morning, the hotel had an emergency alarm go off and so,
everyone ended up getting breakfast around the same time, and there are some very high-profile people in our hotel, since
they put key speakers and organizers together. For some people who are say, from a company, I've been told they had
a choice between their company hotel and the organizers hotel.
- The people here are so lovely, some organizers even gave up their extra rooms to postdocs and other people like that,
so that they could have an opportunity to present their work. So these are the kinds of people who are at the event!

## The night before
- A bunch of us went to a bar run by a Serbian guy, who then directed us to a bar on the other side of the street run by
a Filipino guy, who liked us so much, he gave us shots of Rakija. It was my first time having shots, ever, because
I'm pretty much a hermit and a workaholic. It was tasty, but the whole doing shots thing is probably not my cup of tea.
I really liked the Filipino bar, though, because it totally felt like this 1980s bar with a disco ball with photos
of Florida or SoCal or something like that that seemed to like Billy Ocean a lot (which I could get behind because
he's from my country lol). So that was a lot of fun.

## Some of the sessions
- So because of jet-lag, I have not responded to any recruitment things, I mostly don't remember much what people have
said to me in long conversations at certain times of the day, but it's getting better.
- I did go to an awesome keynote on Copyright Law with Kate Downing, who I also got to speak with at the organizer
reception; she is awesome, and very knowledgeable and brilliant.
- The food has been a bit rough for me; in two weeks, I get to go back to California, though, and I can have fresh
avocado and rice; I am really looking forward to that.
- Oh, I was also notified this week that I'm on some kind of Brilliant Women List, which I'm very honoured to accept!
It's very unexpected, but I'll take it tyvm!
