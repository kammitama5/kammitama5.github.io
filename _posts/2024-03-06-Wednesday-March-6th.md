## Hello from AWS and Birthday!

## We are in Tucson
- It's awesome here! The weather is great, the people are nice, and it's my Birthday!
- I actually got here last Friday, with someone from my lab. We flew together, which was fantastic, but they ended up going
home today, and I will head back tomorrow. I opted to stay the extra night because tonight is the banquet, and it's my birthday!

## It's been a blast
- Okay, so crazy unexpected thing happened and I got into a project group this time (which is quite competitive!) for *the*
elliptic curves *guy*. As in, he wrote the book I studied from for my quals. And, the project had a computational element.
And..best of all, it led to some really awesome results that we will definitely be writing up! Not only that, but we
ended up getting a lot of interest, a lot of questions after our presentation, and even [Mazur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Mazur) told us that our presentation
"was beautiful". If that is not a great birthday, I don't know what is! Also, Drew Sutherland, who helped us parallelize some of our
code in Magma (we started in a mix of Sage and Magma, but ended up doing the core of our computation used for the presentation on
Magma) was also really intrigued!
- Mazur also suggested some other things we could look into as well, and we had a line of people afterwards with questions. So
it's exciting work! Also, the process was quite enjoyable; Silverman didn't end up making it but really stuck with us and met with
us online and was quite responsive and helpful! We even got a cool story that we weaved into our presentation about [Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tate_(mathematician))
and [Coates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Coates) that he sent to us in passing via an email.
- Our group worked every night until midnight, and even had a walk to the 24-hour CVS around the corner to get ice cream after
midnight. It was really a memorable time. Our mentors were wonderful, and it was just a fun time!
- I'll definitely have to post some of the group photos our team took. It was such an epic time.

## I was thinking about what someone said
- I've been thinking about how much interest I've gotten being in Mathematics. In Computer Science, there wasn't (imo) as much interest,
but there seems to be something about the things I am interested in and my skillset that is appealing to the Maths people, and I
remember my Maths advisor saying that the other day, when I was applying for something and trying to decide if I should pick Maths
or Computer Science for reviewers. Her response was "Maths, because I think they would find it interesting". That's been in the
back of my mind for a bit, because I've generally been hired by Mathematicians, they saw potential in me early on (even before
grad school), and seem to work with them easily, and am having a lot of fun doing that. I've also most recently also been working
with some physicists, but the core of people I work with on projects are Mathematicians, which is interesting. I've honestly never
felt more at home, and productive.
- I think that's an interesting point to make, which a labmate and I were talking about the other day; the previous community they
were showing their work to was kind of like "okay, meh", but they suddenly interacted with another, and they were fascinated by
their work. That can be difficult to find, especially as a grad student, but it really is the case that one can find a community
that is adjacent to (or even, not so much adjacent to) one's direct field, and find that they derive a lot of value from what you
can bring to the table. Somewhere you can have a conversation, collaborate, and it's just full of energy and there are just so
many sparks of ideas to try things out. For me right now, that is Maths. There are some really fascinating intersections and
blending of various topics and turning things on their head that is just super cool.
- It reminded me of the first time I attended NeurIPS and got to chat briefly with Professor Bouman from Caltech, who was
quite in the spotlight because of the black hole image. I remember she said to me that whatever I choose, to take the time to
really sit with that community, to be a part of it. I never forgot that, and even though I do bounce around, the Maths community
is, I think, the place where I feel at home. Even if I'm always the only weirdo who happens to be actually in Computer Science lol.
At this point, I am, but I might as well not be lol.
- Anyways, I'm learning a lot, but I feel really valued working with them, and I am *busy*. I keep running into people
who are working on things, wanting to know if a collaboration might be possible. All in all, I'm super
thankful also, and hope that I can give back to this wonderful community that has brought me so much joy in grad school.

## Here are some photos

- A Commutative Algebra conference coming up.

- The group presentations were all amazing. It was really great that everyone supported each other, too.

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws3.png" width="300">

- Yes, there were memes. Sven (also a member of our group!) had an incredible number of really great ones that made us laugh.

- This year's topic.

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws5.png" width="300">

- From my mom. I saw it while we were still working on our presentation in the wee morning. Just after midnight, my group
realized it was also my birthday and we stopped to say Happy Birthday!

- My mom's words to me. Really awesome.

- From my labmate. I'm opening it this evening!

- The people at the tea shop were so used to seeing me they started recommending teas I might like and just gave me some
to try. I came for one cup and left with three!

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws9.png" width="300">

- Next year's topic. Interestingly, I'm currently part of a Group Representation Theory study group that runs weekly online.

- Andy receives a thank you book signed by us on 25 years of AWS.

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws11.png" width="300">

- Mazur gave an awesome set of lectures!

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws12.png" width="300">

- Silverman giving lectures.

- Drew wanting us to come to MIT this year.

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws14.png" width="300">

- More MIT things. I'm interning this summer so probably won't be able to make it.

- Joel Silverbear, as he was called lol

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws16.png" width="300">

- Rachel had some 3D printed glasses that read "mod p" that she brought out during lectures.

- My new friend who got to try on Silverman's name tag on the first day (they then gave it to the bear).

- Bear falling asleep in lectures on the first day!

- View from our window in the mornings.

- Reunited and it feels so good!

<img src="/images1/AWS24pics/aws21.png" width="300">

- So beautiful! They remind me of the wild west, or the painting of Thomas Cole's "The Oxbow" and the Hudson River School paintings
we looked at in Undergrad Art History class. I think in my heart, the allure of the American West is this place of being able to run free, try new
things, and to reimagine. It's probably why I ran away from the East Coast early on, and imo the West Coast is still the best coast lol.

## So how does it feel to be one year older?
- I guess, thrilling. I'm so happy to have been here to share it with some of my favourite people, in a place with fresh
guacamole, the largest cacti and prickly pear tea. I'm excited to see what's next and for future collaborations.

## And that's it.
