## Puzzle, Gifts, RLOS week 9 and PETS

## This week was fantastic
- It's week 9 of RLOS, and things are moving along, although I am *tired*. Even my intern manager said that they saw when I was up 
really late, and someone joked that I need to log off teams if I'm working late. It's totally a joke though; my team
has really awesome and decent hours, and during the holiday or weekend, no one is on, which is nice; great work-life balance.
- As for me, though; I tend to put in a lot of hours.
But, I've just been trying to do the best I can with my time and energy. This is honestly the first team I've been on where
it has been actively acknowledged, though. I've felt like my entire life, I've put in long hours, and it was expected, or even
taken for granted that everyone should do that. I remember years ago, a relative
told me when I graduated undergrad that I would have to learn how to not be working these long hours anymore. Well that never happened.
I took classes and worked freelance gigs while working full-time the entire time. Fortunately, my work ethic has ended up working to my
advantage; when I needed help crossing the border to get a new stamp in my visa in San Diego, it was someone from a freelance gig who helped me,
and if it weren't for taking classes, I wouldn't have acquired all these skills that led me to my current path.

## PETS
- Anyways, this week I attended my first [PETS](https://petsymposium.org/2021/program.php), and got to be on a Happy Hour panel / AMA and made a few friends! It was a bit slow
at the beginning in my panel, so I made an announcement that it was my first PETS and I'd be happy to chat with anyone for whom this was the same,
and soon there was quite a comfortable group of us, and I made a bunch of friends. That was so unexpected!
- There were so many people there just like me, and everyone was interesting and fun, and smart, and kind. We stood around talking about lockpicking,
languages, what we were interested in, and it was wonderful. It made me smile.
- I was also able to make quite a lot of the talks, but I didn't end up doing the virtual escape room (although I've done that before!). I'm excited 
also for the PETS part, where people will be showing their virtual pets! :) Awesome!
- The people there were all wonderful, and it was quite unexpected to be attending my first PETS, and to have met so many people! I made so many new friends!

## Cryptography
- I also found out, unexpectedly, through PETS, that there is someone with my family name who has worked in the field at some very
well-known and prestigious organizations known for that kind of work. We ended up connecting through another contact at PETS I was introduced to during an AMA. 
It's almost like the universe was telling me that I should go ahead, and keep going. And that felt wonderful. Even my Cryptography professor said "wow!" when they
heard the story about the person I had met with my last name. It never happens! I've only ever met such people in Europe (there's a library with my last name!).
- I also ended up hanging out with two of my professors at their place, and I got to meet their very cool dog, and just had a wonderful
time. I left feeling grateful, like they were my guardian angels. Coincidentally, when I was looking for their place, I wasn't sure,
and saw one of them pull out from a garage. So maybe they are my PhD guardians, after all.
- What's silly is that I've been hearing a lot of Computer Science people talk about "Maths being hard". First of all, "Maths" is a large, broad field.
What are you even saying when you say "it's" hard? Its just reminds me of some those dirtbag camera dudes in film who would say that because they didn't
want you to consider what they knew could be a competitive field, so they would try to get you to think it's hard, doubt your ability, and not even try it.
And that's really slimy and gross.
- The last person I heard saying that was a professor at my school who I later found out wasn't even a pure Mathematician; they did Applied Maths. So I dropped
that class like a hot potato; it wasn't worth putting up with that energy for an entire semester lol.
- I think if you've taken even upper level classes in high school Maths you begin to understand this. So way to paint a field with a broad brush lol. I think that that attitude
really is just silly gatekeeping. I have a *lot* of (pure) mathematician friends, and as two recently said "you can learn it, just as every other
mathematican has." I'm not quite sure what it is about Mathematics that some Computer Science people seem to get off on, but the gatekeeping is a bit weird and gross.
I tend to stay away from people with those views, in any case. I think if someone is interested, give them the tools. If they decide it's not for them
or they want to do something else, then that's fine, too. Perhaps they'll take something from that field into the space they're going. And that's really cool.
- I've also been taking part in this workshop (we're on week 2 now), and it's been awesome. A lot of my peers are based in Europe, but I've been
waking up at 4am to attend some of the lectures. I also found out that my guardian angel professor ended up recommending me for another workshop
related to the topic, which I was surprised and so grateful for when they mentioned it.

## Puzzles
- I took part in a Puzzle Hunt this past weekend. It was pretty awesome! Most of our team ended up not showing up, but myself and another person
ended up knocking out many of the puzzles on Saturday and Sunday. I enjoyed it so much I signed up for another one this weekend!
- I also signed up for a CTF, too, in two weeks from now :). Now I have to work at a place with a puzzlehunt culture, now!

## I won a gift!
- I saw this book in my mailbox, and there was a scratch card where, if you saw a QR code, it meant you won a prize! 
- And so I did; a pair of headphones! Thank you so much!!!

## Being yourself
- One of my very near and dear friends discovered more about themselves, and I felt happy for them. I grew up around a lot of theatre kids,
and for many of those kids, theatre was a refuge. They were teased outside of that space, bullied, harassed, and being in theatre was a space
for geeks and outcasts. It's interesting that in undergrad, I was the outcast among the theatre kids, in the same way that I find it odd when
techies treat others like outcasts; for many of us, these spaces and hobbies were things that bound us together, even as outcasts. 
- And so, I'm sensitive to groups and outcasts, or loners, because I've felt that for years and years, even growing up. And years later,
I've had many of my friends tell me in private that they're thankful that I didn't treat them as an outcast. There's a peace and happiness in being
able to be yourself, a contentment in being who you are.

## Loneliness
- I was thinking this week that I've been super comfortable during quarantine; one of my friends said I was the hardest to motivate to come out of my place
to socialize. And I thought back about when I was in Los Angeles, and why sailing felt so natural to me; it is a very solitary endeavour. You have to be
comfortable with solitude, or your own thoughts. In the mornings before work, I would read books, and use my highlighters; at the time, I was reading books
on electronics and learning the resistor codes, or about buildings and craftsmanship (I still love construction shows). So in many ways, I've been an academic
for a long time, even reading and self-studying while working full-time. And being in academic, although there is collaboration, involves a lot of solitude and
reflection. I've been alone, but I've never felt lonely. I feel happy with who I am by myself, and for those I love, we can sit in silence and enjoy each other's
company. I've felt like I've gotten to do so much during quarantine; I wrote a language, met a bunch of people, drew and painted, and have continued to engage in
self-study. It has made me contemplate what I want for my future, based on who I am. But who really knows?

## Anyways, I guess that's it
