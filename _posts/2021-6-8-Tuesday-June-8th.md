## Living between two worlds

## It occurred to me
- It occurred to me suddenly, when I posted that I had started my internship, that I was living between two societies, or rather a part of both, even though
I had not experienced one for quite some time. It came to me in the form of backlash by a particular individual who tried to diminish the congratulatory 
responses of the general group. Furthermore, it was from a woman. The backlash, though, felt *familiar* because it was a part of something I grew up with a lot.
- A lot of it felt familiar, because it reminded me of an internalized self-loathing that pops up culturally from time to time.
- My country was reeling a while ago, from the murder of a young woman who was [simply](https://trinidadexpress.com/newsextra/2-suspects-confessed-to-robbing-andrea-who-just-wanted-to-go-home/article_b8c3ca7c-6afd-11eb-b47c-9bc7441fbdda.html) trying to get [home from work](http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/police-hold-four-in-search-of-angel-andrea-6.2.1283419.86fbc6d06c).
- I've thought about how sometimes, in some environments, just existing is a threat to someone's self-worth, and how to cope with that, because I've dealt with
that over and over, for the entirety of my life.
- I'm not American, nor did I grow up in the United States, so I can't speak specifically about any movements or affiliations here, but only my own cultural
experience growing up in my own home country. It's something I've been thinking about for a *long* while.

## The beginning
- A while ago, I visited Brooklyn, which is pretty populated by immigrants from my country, and I was waiting for my favourite roti shop to open, and I was
first in line. Two guys entered, were chatting with each other, and one looked me up and down and stepped in front of me, casually. Fortunately, the lady
at the counter, upon opening, stated flatly "she was here first, so I'll be helping her first." But it's very much a part of the kind of thing I experienced
a lot growing up. Not in my immediate family, thankfully, but it's a big part of the culture I grew up with, and have wrestled with for years.
- Maybe this may resonate with some, but I've had friends who grew up in cultures where it's more favourable to birth a boy instead of a girl. In fact,
I've had quite a few international friends who, if you got to know them, would say "my parents wanted a boy". I had a strange experienced years ago 
when someone I knew invited me to meet a friend (an immigrant living and working) in Silicon Valley, and I was introduced to their family. Openly, the parent of that child turned to us
and said about his daughter, after praising his son, "look at her; she's so stupid". It was said in a tone of resentment, and I recognize it all too well.
I'm not sure about if this is something that is also a part of growing up in the United States, as I said, but I've lived through parts of that culture 
where it is hinted, as a woman, that you should not appear too smart, not shine too bright. And I've wrestled with that for years, and what it means for
the valuation of one's contributions, understanding all the things I've done and all the things I want to be.
- I've also thought about it in the context of meeting other persons from such countries, looking deliberately to see whether they perpetuate those mindsets.
These people are, after all, the very people who have the ability to hire us, promote our work, and advocate for us.

## From school to working
- One of the things I wrestled with a lot was how, in my own all-female high school, we were encouraged to be leaders, to forge our own paths. It was a special, very
pedigreed school where we were told we could find a place in any sector of society, while wearing our prefect ties and uniforms. However, once I stepped out of that all-female environment, there was
a different reality. At one of my first jobs, I remember kindly asking a gentleman I was working with if they could carry out the task that a superior asked
me to relay to his staff, and the gentleman's response of turning away from me and telling his coworkers "I'm not taking orders from a woman".
- At the time, I didn't feel any sort of rage or empowerment in the way the women in this country I currently live in speak openly. I did feel a resignation
that this was how they were raised, and our society itself empowered that sense of entitlement. Even if I did speak up about it, its efforts would be temporary.
And after all, I was only 18.

## But what does this have to do with today?
- I think about advocacy and value today in work, in support. I've changed quite a bit from a shyer version of myself (although I was always a smart-ass; that
hasn't changed), because I've lived with years of sometimes being fed-up, of pretending to be not as smart, not as well-spoken, not as clever, so that I can
give way to my male counterparts. That was the world I grew up in. I've also seen a backlash to that, which has had its own levels of toxicity, too, when taken
to extremes. And sometimes I wonder from time to time if I am stepping out of line, as I've been told sometimes. But if I don't advocate for myself, who will?
As I've often seen, often no one. Nothing; my voice, my work, or my value, will be heard. Being rude or out of line is better than being a ghost of who I am. 
So it's worth a shot.

## And that's it
