## Some grad students have books
- Some grad students have a space for books they are reading or have read or recommend along the way of study. Here are a list of ones on my radar,
either that I'm currently making my way through, will in the very near future, or will during my research for foundational knowledge.
Okay, let me be more honest; at the time of my writing this, these are all on my bed or on my working desk, meaning that I've fallen asleep
while reading them, gotten up again to work through them, rinse, repeat. But I'm determined to get through *every single one*.
- I thought about sorting them, or putting them in order of "more undergraduate-y" or "definitely graduate", but I decided not to do this.
I don't think it matters; it's more of a "some of these are helpful, depending on what your needs are" kind of space.
- Make of it what you will *shrug*.
- I despise thin books (ie those with a small number of pages, unless it's Jonathan Livingston Seagull (lol)), but my back hurts from carrying thick ones!
- Oh, you might notice that none of these are programming books. Good! I'm glad you noticed. It's not an accident :)

## Papers
- I'm not that great at keeping track right now, but I do have a github repo with these.
- Perhaps after I've completed everything, I'll make this public.

## For Future
- It would be nice to look back or add to over the years references that were useful to me, so why not start now.

## That's it for now.
