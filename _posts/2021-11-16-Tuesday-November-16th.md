## Books

## Some grad students have books
- Some grad students they are reading or have read or recommend along the way of study. Here are a list of ones on my radar,
either that I'm currently making my way through, will in the very near future, or will during my research for foundational knowledge.

## Books
- Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective by Crandall, R. and Pomerance C.
- Rational Points on Ellpitic Curves by Silverman J. and Tate J.
- How to Solve It by Polya G.
- Topological Graph Theory by Gross J. and Tucker T.
- Contemporary Abstract Algebra by Gallian J.
- Algebra for Cryptologists by Meijer A.
- The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves by Silverman J.
- A Transition to Advanced Mathematics by Smith D, Eggen M and St. Andre R.
- A Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography by Hankerson D, Menezes A and Vanstone S.
- Bridging the Gap to University Mathematics by Gould M. and Hurst E.
- Extremal Graph Theory by Bollobas B.
- Real Analysis by Cummings J.
- Abstract Algebra by Dummit D. and Foote R. (fun fact; they taught at my University while they wrote this)
- Abstract Algebra, Hernstein, I. N.

## Papers
- I'm not that great at keeping track right now, but I do have a github repo with these.
- Perhaps after I've completed everything, I'll make this public.

## For Future
- It would be nice to look back or add to over the years references that were useful to me, so why not start now.

## That's it for now.
