## Data Continued...

## This is really quite fun!

- I'm *really* enjoying the Data Science work. It's challenging, rewarding, but it also makes sense.

- Today, I analyzed some wine data

## We started out with two csv files

- They were initially separated by semi-colons, so had to fix that!

- Observed the data, created a white and red column for each dataset and merged to two in a new edited file
  containing both datasets
  
- I verified that both datasets were, in fact, appended by  looking at the head and tail of the dataset

## I made a mistake!

- On the first try, I accidentally set the header to false, so the edited file had no Header for the Columns. Yikes!

- Fixed it! That meant updating the edited file!

- So far, so good!

## Visualizations
