## A Cloudy Day

## So...

- I missed the last day of my workshop to stay up from 
  4am to 1:30am the next day doing a course that was
  supposed to take one week to complete...and I did it 
  in one day!

## Um...

- See, I was given this coupon, and it gave me access to
  the class for free, and the training is super important
  for me, but I had to complete it by July 2nd.
  
- Since I start a *new* workshop which may have a heavy
  workload, in addition to the Udacity Nanodegree,
  I *had* to make sure I got it done before I started
  my workshop today.
  
## And so I did...

- Basically, it's a warming-up to some of the concepts
  I'll be doing for another workshop in July, and possibly
  for some technologies I'll be learning in September.
  
## My Impression

- I did some of these labs last year at Google LA 
  (for three days). Basically, they've integrated this 
  training (intro) into a Cousera specialization.
  I guess they're hoping that people get up to speed and
  that the on-site training will be more in-depth.
  Hooray to that.

- Man, was it *really* unpolished back when I took it,
  although I 
  was happy to learn. 
  
## Differences

- When I did tiny bits of the course last year,
  the instructions were pretty gnarly. That has changed.
  
- Also, you'd have to remember your Project ID,
  only they wouldn't tell you, so you'd have to go back
  and find it, in the very buggy interface, praying and 
  hoping that it would go OK.
  Now, you just type PROJECT_ID and it uses the name of your
  project ID. Excellent!

 - It was dependency *hell* last time, and I had gotten a 
   lot of errors and warnings. Now..things just sort of 
   *work*.
   
- I did get *one* error, but I was able to fix it by
  looking up their thorough documentation.

- Also, last time, the labs were sort of Ad-hoc.
  So I wasn't sure when they said to "clean up" your interface
  after each lab, whether that meant I'd have to delete it 
  completely or not. 
  Of course, when the next part said "remember that thing 
  you did last time?" (you didn't delete it, right?),
  it was a source of frustration and an accumulation 
  of errors...but they fixed it!
  
## This means "You didn't mess it up" in JSON!

- Cue the cat memes! 

## Organization meets logic

- Now it's one entire, sequential lab, which is nice!

## I'm running instances and containers and stuff! The joy!

- I *did* screw up on the External IP API for *one* lab,
  but because it's so much better organized,
  that sort of thing is an easy fix.
  
## Maybe I just understand it better, now.

- Everything just sort of *made sense*

## I even did some Queries on Big Query

## So yeah..

- With my newly minted certificate in hand, 
  I'm going to sleep...to be up in a few hours 
  to head to my first Workshop in "Coding for Product".
  
- See you there? :)
