## Sparklecon 5

## Hello from Sparklecon 5. 
- My yearly commute to Fullerton. My beloved poke place closed (I visited for the past two years for Taro snow and Poke), but
  otherwise, pretty much the same area. I even got some ramen to take home with me.

## What is Sparklecon?
- It's an event that is put on by 23b, a staple of the Hacker community. 

## But you're not a Hacker..or are you?
- Yes, that is true. I am *not* a hacker. However, I consider these people to be some of my very good friends, and the 
  community is part of the reason I got into programming in the first place. They're a sister organization of my 
  Hackerspace, and I try to support them when I can. 
- Also, they taught me a *lot* of the little bit I know about how computers work. Understanding file systems,
  how autentication and crypto works, which helped me to start to ask questions and to understand a bit more about 
  computers. I took my first Metasploit, crypto, PHP, Assembly workshops at my Hackerspace. I SSH-ed into my first box 
  there. I learned a bit about how raytracing works there, which got me excited about C and making things in C++. 
- These people are the real deal, and I think regardless of *how* you find your way to computing or computers, it's good
  to be around these people because they fill in *so* much knowledge. They're the real deal and a *great* community. 
- Also, my Hackerspace even taught a workshop on Emacs, which should be coming around again soon. I mean..do you know
  of *anywhere* (school, boot camp) that does that? Yeah..neither do I.
  
## So..what happens at Sparklecon?
- It's a mix of presentations but on by people in the community, and then things like robot battles, PCB-soldering, 
  drone-flying, tesla-coil demos, video-game playing and other such things that people in the general maker-scene like. 
  It's fun and I came back energized. 
  
## Generally in the Hacker community
- People have handlers, so they often don't use real names. 
- They also like their privacy. 
- They also are a good judge of whether you have an earnest interest in being a part of the community, and if so, 
  are really helpful and welcoming.
- The general vibe is libertarian.
  
## Talks today
- I went to one on Electric Trains, another on Machine Learning, another on Projection mapping, another on Crypto,
  and one on Impacket (which I totally do not understand, but it helped that it was in Python).
- I also met a bunch of people who were interested in everything from C, Rust, Erlang, Go, Perl, Python. They like 
  challenges.
  
## Pics

## Projection Mapping

- Tim works for Apple and showed us some work he does in 3D projection mapping.

<img src="/images/scon18/s2.png" width="400">
- He showed us a bit of Modul8 and Maya and how he uses it for Projection mapping on a couch.
  Interestingly, his friend was into computational linguistics, so we had a chat about that. 
  
## Audio

- We have a wicked audio set-up every year. This is a part of a live audio DJ who plays (we had about three
  this year). It involves a bunch of wires, a motor, among another things. I should credit him, but I can't
  remember his name! Apologies!
  
## PCB Soldering

<img src="/images/scon18/s4.png" width="400">
- This year the task was to make a radio transmitter/ receiver. So a bunch of people were soldering parts.
  My friend, Benson, got his to work and we were listening to random stations via his headphones.

## Recycled components

<img src="/images/scon18/s5.png" width="400">
- This is artwork by CP. These are recycled boards and components used to make art.

- This was continued in a trend where people made kilts, bracelets, and armour from laptop keyboards,
  and all sorts of things. I think someone made a headpiece, also.

## Legos

<img src="/images/scon18/s9.png" width="400">

- People were making robots and stuff with a plethora of legos available. You could prety much 
  build whatever you wanted. Oh, and there were tools and there was hot glue and soldering irons.
  
## Hammer Jenga

<img src="/images/scon18/s11.png" width="400">

- So there is this other conference later in the year (ie Memorial Weekend), and you can win a free
  ticket by winning this game, which is a huge version of Jenga, where you hit the blocks out with a 
  hammer. There is a fair amount of strategy and pressure in the game, as the blocks were not on level
  ground, you have a bit of wind to compete with, and the judge's taunts (thanks DG :D), and blocks
  that have split so much in the past that they are taped together (not a good idea to knock those out!).
  You knock the block you pick off, and once you commit to it, you have to knock that one out. After you
  do that, you place that one on top and hand the hammer over. You can only knock out blocks at least three 
  levels from the top. You play against a person in a round until the tower falls, and then the winner
  goes to the next round. The person who won the first ticket was "Girl" :D.

- Oh, and the photo was taken *just* seconds before the entire tower fell :(
  
## Other random stuff

<img src="/images/scon18/s12.png" width="400">

- CP made a phone booth that was really really cool. People were taking photos in it, and there were some
  interesting things, like a baby's body with cameras on top. 

## I assume

- This is a chip-tune maker. 

## All in all
- A really fun time, and great catching up with everyone.
  Even though I'm pretty green, it really feels like they see you as one of them, which is nice.
  So I got some great advice in terms of direction and all of that, for the next part of my life.
  So we'll see.
  
## Oh
- Since I figured out how to download the files, I'm thinking of doing this assignment for my Nanodegree
  in Julia. So I think I'll spend tomorrow working on that. Then sadly, I'll have to focus on Python
  for the rest of the week until my sailing trip
  
## And..that's that!
