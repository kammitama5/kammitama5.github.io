## So Forth

## Yeah...so I've been busy
- Specifically, just doing applications and other such stuff. 
  In between, I managed to watch two Haskell Streams (one was on a game with textures and stuff and
  the other involved Tic-Tac-Toe). So that was pretty fun. Today, I was able to ask
  the streamer questions about how he learned, what was the biggest hurdle, etc. 
- Oh yeah, and I bought a book on making web apps in Haskell, to complement the other book I'm reading
  which is actually teaching me Haskell. 
- Also..I gave a short (2 minute) talk on Haskell! It was my first tech talk! I had a lot of fun, but
  I had to leave early because I had to get up at 4:30am to head to my dock for race training.
  
## Thursday
- I met up with my mentor and we had a blast. Two of my friends from school came along, and we had
  *such* a great time that they had to kick us out of JPL with a smile :D
  My friend, Patrick, was pretty entranced. I think he wants to work in aerospace now. My two friends
  had a lot of fun, and my mentor was very happy to entertain them and tell them details about missions.
  
## A new Yacht Club
- It was at a club I hadn't been to before. It's a really nice club, and I met some people I had 
  sailed with before.
- The event was for people who wanted to get into this year's race season or just learn and train
  on racing. Subsequently, I signed up for two more such events (one Intro, one Advanced) at my
  regular Yacht club, on April 7th and 14th respectively :D
  
## So what did you learn?
- How to haul @$$ and beat people. I was on the winning boat, and we smoked them! :D
  This (above) was our boat. It's 50' long.

- We even got yelled at by another racer who wasn't racing because he got in *our* way
  and we yelled "Starboard" at him and he got all upset. Racing is *famous* for A-Types.
  It's pretty competitive and a lot of fun, and I even met a programmer!
  
 ## This week
 - I have this recruitment event on Tuesday, another on Thursday. Mon and Wed are class.
   Oh yeah, I think we are moving on to writing Ada. I did *not* enjoy COBOL. At all.
 - I have to start contacting the persons I promised to contact for my research for a project.
   That starts this week.
 - I have to finish up another application (just recommendations) for a possible Fall research
   opportunity that would last a year. 
   
 ## And that's it!
