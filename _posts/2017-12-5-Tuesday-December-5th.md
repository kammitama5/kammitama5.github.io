## John Hopkins APL and Flight Software Workshop (FSW)

## Hello from Maryland! 

- I'm staying at a really nice hotel about six minutes' walk from the South Campus of John Hopkins APL.
- The APL is the Applied Physics Lab, which is located in Laurel, Maryland.
- They're involved in all sorts of projects, particularly for Space.

- Here are some of the units (models) from their main lobby

## So....what's this FSW?

- The Flight Software Workshop (now in its 10th year) is a meeting of organizations
  like APL, NASA centres, etc, to talk about and present on Software for things like
  autonomous missions. Anyone is able to attend, but for some strange reason, I was one 
  of only two students who attended. So it was pretty neat; I was surrounded by some really
  knowledgeable people!
  
## The first day

- We had presentations on CFS, which is the Core Flight System. It is NASA Goddard's baby. 
  I hadn't heard of it before, but it used quite heavily internally by many such centres.
  I've also heard that JPL sort of wants to do its own version...JPL..the rebel..haha.
  So since that's the closest NASA centre to me, sort of makes sense that I hadn't heard of it much :)
  There were quite a few JPL-ers there as well.
