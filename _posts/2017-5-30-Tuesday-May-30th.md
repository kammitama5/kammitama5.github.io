## More notes on Category Theory...

## Getting Caught up

- I'm getting caught up on all the work I missed.
  I have completed a quiz, a homework assignment, and a board discussion thingy.
  I just have a lab to finish, and to make notes for a quiz next week.
  
  
- Also, my Un-bootcamp starts (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
  again this upcoming Saturday
  for four weekends. There is a pre-assigment,
  so I have to get caught up on that, too.
  
## Here are some notes I took today:
