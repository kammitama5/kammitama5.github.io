## HACS Hack Day 2024

## I went to Hack Day today
- I spent the first part of the morning deciding whether to go to the EasyCrypt tutorial or the Jasmin one,
and decided to learn about [Jasmin](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin) instead. Then I got nerd-swiped
by a friend, Victor, who helped me work on a research project, and we looked at some code and some solutions
together and it was lunch. We decided we would follow up after the conference.
- Then, my other friend, Asra and myself decided after she was back from the Market, we'd walk an hour to get
Trini roti. And yes, we did that. It was such a lovely experience because as it turns out, culturally,
we share a lot of foods, which was pretty heart-warming. 
Then we went to a Chocolatier place and shared some together. It was
wonderful! We passed through Chinatown on the way back, and I even saw my other friend, Jeremy, who
waved at me on the way back, as they were having dinner, and I felt kind of bad not joining them, but
I was pretty tired by then. It's been a day! And it's been so wonderful to have new friends, and I'm
particularly happy to have met Asra, who walked an hour one way and back to have roti (and doubles!) with me, and
amazing chocolate at SOMA! I feel happy to have made it, and we gave each other a warm hug as we parted.
- Also hilarious story; we both went a little wild in Chinatown looking at snacks to take with us,
but we didn't end up actually taking any because well, as it turns out, we can't fly with them.
And then we were like, why don't we live here again!? We also figured that at some point over summer,
we should try to hang out!

## Here are some photos from today from our journey!
