## Katas

- if you can fill an order based on stock, return true
  else return False. SKUs baby!
  
```
def fillable(stock, merch, n):
    for key in stock:
      if merch in stock:
        if key == merch and stock[key] >= n:
          return True
          break;
        elif key == merch and stock[key] < n:
          return False
      else:
        return False
        break; 
    return
```
