## Tomorrow is my Birthday :D

## I managed
- I managed to finish up a quiz, an assignment and install Android 3.0 for this workshop this upcoming Saturday.
  That was sort of a pain, but Googs invited me to do the workshop, so why not?
  In the midst of that, there is our online PureScript Meetup. So....yeah. Thankfully PureScript
  records their meetings. Hopefully Googs has a nice, long lunch so I can watch some of the stream!
- I'm also volunteering to help out with Registration at [SCALE](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x).
- In the midst of that...Haskell. At night, I've been reading Denotational Semantics (the unabridged novel :D)

## Haskell
- I'm currently on chapter 4 of Haskellbook. So far, so good. It's on DataTypes. 
- I have Stack installed on various devices, particularly on a Windows machine, along with Notepad++. 
  
## Set-up
- Here is the code on Notepad++
