## Notes from Thursday Tutoring Session

- Once a week, my mentor and I sit down and have dinner,
  and talk about parsers, compilers, and programming 
  language theory.
  
## This was from our first session

- He's explaining parsers and recursive descent to me.

- Also, LL-1 vs LL-0 parsing.

## I started thinking about Python

- One of the things that has fascinated me is trying to understand
  *what* a plus sign is to a compiler. What does it mean,
  and how does it know hierarchy. 
  
- It makes sense for the hierarchy to represent it as a graph structure.
  But it's really quite interesting; concepts like LL-1 and LL-0 parsers,
  their complexity and efficiency. 
  
## Things I learned about 

- fixed point iteration (calcuating nullable)
- NDFA to DFA (removing epsilon transitions)
- sentential form (not yet a sentence..like a phrase)
- tokens
- abstract syntax trees
- recursive descent
- LL vs LR parsers
- epsilon vs lambda transitions
- "chickenfoot" (independent of in mathematical notation)
- expression vs expression follows (peek operation)
  
## I found some resources online

- They Python documentation actually contains Lexical analysis documentation. I didn't know that until today.

- This is from a [college course](http://matt.might.net/teaching/compilers/spring-2015/).
  It's from the University of Utah.

  I love this 
  
  ```
  Few programmers will ever work on a production compiler,
  but knowing how compilers think is an asset.

  It makes you a better programmer.
  ```
  
## Also a wonderful Paul Graham article

- This stuck out today for me

 ```
 ...I'll call the Python paradox; 
 if a company chooses to write its
 software in a comparatively 
 esoteric language, they'll be able 
 to hire better programmers,
 because they'll attract only those who cared 
 enough to learn it....
 for programmers...if you want to get a good
 job..the language to learn is a language that people 
 don't learn merely to get a job.
 ```
 
 Read the entire article [here](http://paulgraham.com/pypar.html)
 
- I completely agree with this! 
  It just makes sense to me, and I have to say the smartest,
  most passionate people I've met are people who have learned
  some interesting language, or built something interesting,
  or they taught themselves a language because they were 
  really interested and curious and passionate about programming.

## I'm still stoked

- I'm excited about the LinkedIn opportunity.
  I was reading a question on Quora today,
  where someone answered that life really 
  "unfolds". That's very much been the case
  in my life, and for that, I'm thankful. 
  
## For the week

- Tomorrow, I'm going to a Sailing club. 
  I officially joined a sailing group for women.
  
- I also have class on Wednesday, and hang out with 
  my mentor (for a tutoring session) on Thursday evening.
  
## Things to be done...

- Version 1.1 of my C++ programme

- Data Analysis and finish up Nanodegree

- And..that's about it!
