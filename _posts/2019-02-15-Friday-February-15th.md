## My first Week and Finding a Fit

## I started my Spring internship

- It has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life so far. I say this because I feel like I am:
  - appreciated and valued
  - being listened to; my opinions matter, even struggling through learning
  - being given autonomy while given the opportunity to grow and succeed
  - being set-up to succeed
  - being treated like I am a part of the team, *even as an intern*.
  
## Firstly 

- My manager had an initial chat with me about compensation in Silicon Valley. He also told me before signing
  an offer, feel free to have a cup of coffee with him to chat about everything. This was *amazing*. I really 
  feel like he is someone long-term who is looking out for me and is a real mentor for me. It's amazing.
  
- He also said that as the rest of our group are full-timers, to feel free to reach out to him if cost is a problem
  for anything. He was sensitive to the fact that I basically moved my life up to Silicon Valley. I thought that
  this was really considerate of him, because this was the case. I'm doing alright, but it's good that he was 
  considerate of this and didn't assume that I came to the Valley with a bunch of money and resources. 
  
## Secondly
  
- I think as a junior developer, even though many of us are concerned with the name of the company,
  where it is located, the pay, etc, the most significant attribute of an internship or job is the *right fit*.
- The right fit with a team, a project, and a company is worth its weight in gold.
- I had several revelations this week; I remembered at one point a friend told me "what if what you want in your 
  head is just a fantasy? Maybe you shouldn't be so picky". This week has *proved* that she was wrong :D.
  I'm happy I stuck to my guns and waited for the *right* opportunity. 

## I'm reflecting on this

- I know that the junior market is competitive. I know that I have friends and peers who are concerned about
  getting their foot in the door, making money, paying off loans, etc. However, it is still *so* worth it to find
  the *right* spot for you; it is the one in which you will probably grow the most, feel the most comfortable
  and form the best friendships. 
  
## Moving forward

- I'm probably going to spend this weekend doing Haskell and learning some other stuff. It's been a wild ride
  so far and I just feel really grateful and happy for this week.
