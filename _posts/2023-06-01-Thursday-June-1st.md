## Theorem Prover Summer School

## Two Week Summer School
- I have been attending a Summer School on Formal Methods for the past two weeks! It's truly been amazing.
- I have a confession; I haven't done any Computer Science things in a while, and I had a *lot* of anxiety once I found
out there would be a fair number of Computer Science PhD students there. As it turns out, I would say it was about 80 percent
CS people, and 20 percent Maths (Model Theory people, etc), with some people from industry (Nvidia, Sandia, etc) too. And it 
was exceptional.
- It was a very close-knit group, and even though we worked together, we also took a trip to San Francisco, did a hike at the 
Stanford Dish Trail and campus, did trips to various tech companies, the Computer History museum, and all the things (including
several boba runs). In fact, it's been so positive that a group of us will continue to learn one of the theorem provers together and continue to meet after the workshop ends, which is amazing!

## As for the workshop
- The format was as such: in the first week, we had lectures in the morning, and labs in the afternoon (two each), where we 
were exposed to various Theorem Provers such as the Vampire Theorem prover, Alloy, PVS, and TPTP. TPTP has wonderful syntax,
and Geoff's website adds a delay to a random if you don't donate, which I thought was pretty funny.
- We honestly also got enough knowledge to build our own theorem prover, too, which is awesome and something maybe I do in the future (with more time, after my PhD).
- We had a lovely talk by Carolyn Talcott on McCarthy's paper for its 60th birthday, and a session with Leslie Lamport on Paxos.
- We also did questions like a Soduku solver, and DDH using Easycrypt. Easycrypt looks interesting and definitely something I may put my hands on in the future, as it's very applicable to some of the work I'm doing.

## My purpose for attending
- I'm learning Lean in-depth this summer on my own, and am interested in using it as a tool for my work now and in the future.
- It made me realize that I can completely learn and use these tools (I liked Isabelle as well, but sticking with Lean for now),
and I don't have to be interested in Programming Languages necessarily (not everyone wants to build languages! I wish some communities would stop selling formal verification as "PL" because there's a distinction that can be missed between the communities), but just use it as a tool for checking my assumptions about cryptography as I work through a system (modelling behavior, verifying my assumptions are correct). So that's kind of been my goal. Plus, a lot of Mathematicians seem to like it, so unlike some of the other tools, it's not a tool that would distance me from the community I want to be a part of as I continue to do research.
- Also, finally, good news: I got into another workshop on my topic of research, which will be in August! I'm super stoked about that!

## In Conclusion
- I highly recommend it!
- There are a number of fields that could benefit from these methods, and in particular, what they emphasize is in particular fields that do not know they necessarily need them, rather than just the typical "programming languages" approach. In fact, I used to think
that PL was formal verification, but they're two quite separate fields, and I really enjoyed learning about them in a context that
wasn't just focused on programming languages techniques and approaches. I learned so much, and it was very applicable to my area of
research! I would definitely like to return within a year, having stuck with Lean and with the working group (using PVS) to see how that would impact my experience.

## That's it
