## Theorem Prover Summer School

## Two Week Summer School
- I have been attending a Summer School on Formal Methods for the past two weeks! It's truly been amazing.
- I have a confession; I haven't done any Computer Science things in a while, and I had a *lot* of anxiety once I found
out there would be a fair number of Computer Science PhD students there. As it turns out, I would say it was about 80 percent
CS people, and 20 percent Maths (Model Theory people, etc), with some people from industry (Nvidia, Sandia, etc) too. And it 
was exceptional.
- It was a very close-knit group, and even though we worked together, we also took a trip to San Francisco, did a hike at the 
Stanford Dish Trail and campus, did trips to various tech companies, the Computer History museum, and all the things (including
several boba runs).

## As for the workshop
- The format was as such: in the first week, we had lectures in the morning, and labs in the afternoon (two each), where we 
were exposed to various Theorem Provers such as the Vampire Theorem prover, Alloy, PVS, and TPTP. TPTP has wonderful syntax,
and Geoff's website adds a delay to a random if you don't donate, which I thought was pretty funny.
- We had a lovely talk by Carolyn Talcott on McCarthy's paper for its 60th birthday, and a session with Leslie Lamport on Paxos.
- We also did questions like a Soduku solver, and DDH using Easycrypt. Easycrypt looks interesting and definitely something I may put my hands on in the future, as it's very applicable to some of the work I'm doing.

## My purpose for attending
- I'm learning Lean in-depth this summer on my own, and am interested in using it as a tool for my work now and in the future.
- It made me realize that I can completely learn and use these tools (I liked Isabelle as well, but sticking with Lean for now),
and I don't have to be interested in Programming Languages necessarily, but just use it as a tool for checking my assumptions about cryptography as I work through a system. So that's kind of been my goal. Plus, a lot of Mathematicians seem to like it, so unlike some of the other tools, it's not a tool that would distance me from the community I want to be a part of as I continue to do research.
- Also, finally, good news: I got into another workshop on my topic of research, which will be in August! I'm super stoked about that!
