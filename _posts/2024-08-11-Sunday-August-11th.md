## Last day of QSim Summer School

## It's the last day
- Today was the last day of my first QSim summer school. It's actually the 2nd time that it's been held. It was
a really great experience. Everyone is super friendly, good listener, and I enjoyed chatting with everyone.
I learned a bunch, people seemed super interested in my area of research and I even got invited to speak at an
upcoming university! So yay!

## After the summer school
- So we had to check out of the dorms by 9am, but hilariously, my friend and I went to pick up a car rental
the evening before, so we just put our suitcases in the rental and headed to the final day of the workshop.
We gave two German PhD students a ride to their hotel.
Afterwards, we both went with a mutual friend from Oxford to the beach in Narragansett, and then had lobster rolls,
chatted and I even had two glasses of quite lovely wine. It was a lot of fun, and then when we dropped off our
friend, we headed to our hotels in Providence.
