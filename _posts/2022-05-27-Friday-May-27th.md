## Research Week 3, the Dream Team and You do You

## This week
- We continued our research, and my mentor was nice enough to write an entire blog post on a research website about
our project and our progress, and even linked to our blogs! How cool!? I'm super thankful for how much he is truly
invested in our success and our growth, and to just being a part of this community. It's been fantastic!
- I've also been learning German. Well, not really. I've been learning German colloquialisms from my research team; the first one I have learned
is "You do you", which makes me smile because I hilariously translate it to how it would be said in my home country (which
would *totally* be more passive aggressive, with an eyeroll to add some spice lol), which is very 
different from the way they (my German peers) use it.
- I spent the week learning and adjusting some code I'm working on, as well as a mathematical model in terms of a formal proof
/ definition. We also lucked out in that we found both a really cool paper and another one was given to us that will both
be of great help for us to build on moving forward. So I've been making my way through those as well.
I realized that I absolutely *love* doing this stuff; I could do it forever! How can I make this my career!? 
- My mentor said that the result already makes a really great theoretical paper, which is amazing!! It honestly hasn't felt like
work, but I have spent entire days realizing that it was late at night and that I had spent most of the day working on research.
I believe this week one morning at 3am I also had a 90s - 2000s latin rock music sing along to unwind.
- Finally, we had a group meeting! So I finally got to meet the other student with whom I am working, who is a graduate student
(finishing up) with a lot of knowledge, but with so much humility and just a superbly fun disposition, 
and just is an awesomely fun person to work with! I really could not be happier! He described our group as "the dream team", which
was shocking and made me simultaneously really happy! We're excited for our progress and the energy towards the project has been
really amazing. 

## Other things
- I received a grant to attend Oakland virtually this year via a workshop my WiCyS mentor told me about, and received my ticket to attend
the AWM Research Symposium after the Roots of Unity workshop, which I had received a spot for in the Arithmetic Geometry group
and was granted a virtual ticket to attend GHC this year (which is great because I'm doing a butt load of Maths classes this Fall
because I just want to do Pure Mathematics forever and live until I am 200 so I can just keep taking Pure Mathematics classes
because they're awesome!!). 
I am *so* stoked!!! One of the mathematicians I've been dying to meet *forever* is giving a topology talk on Covers at the AWM
Research Symposium!!! How cool is that!?
- I also heard from my BlackComputeHer mentor, who is *amazing*, wrapped up a mentorship with my NCWIT mentor at Facebook research
(who is seriously the coolest cat ever! He's so level-headed but fun), 
and worked on a wrap-up blogpost with my co-organizer partner in crime from ICLR (smile). I burst out laughing because we sort of 
stumbled upon an idea that we are now *dying* to try, and played around with it last night. It will be executed!! She's so creative
that even though it was a long day, we sometimes get into fun mischief that makes the meeting time incredibly fun!
- I was also invited to two events already in the city I'm moving to (including at one place / institution I've wanted to attend forever), 
received awesome swag (!!) (I will make a post about this but there is a lot I can't talk about specifically),
attended a book club, a few talks, and had a conversation with a company about my plans after graduation and what I was thinking
of next (ha). Honestly, I haven't thought that much about it at all. My thoughts that day stopped at "I'll have oatmeal for breakfast".
So that was interesting to think about, and to hear from the market that my skillset is very much in demand (which is pretty awesome).
Honestly, as I had mentioned, I'm more interested in building solid relationships, and based on those relationships,
I would make a choice, I think. I'm more interested in that and how interesting the problems are than the prestige of a company or whatever.
- I will say that the skills I pick up this summer will be *very* important in doing good work on my current research project; they're very
much complementary. I'm hoping to 
improve on these skills so I get better and have a better intuition for how to problem-solve in this domain.

## Stuff from this week
- I went to a stats book club this week in which we went over Hypothesis testing, Pearson's Chi-Squared test, Simple vs
Composite Hypotheses, Student's Distribution, Power of Test, ( <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1-\beta"> ),
Mendelian randomization vs Clinical (funnily
enough, a childhood friend just did her disseratation on this; she just graduated from Oxford in epidemiology).
Asymptotically correct test, Type I vs Type II.
- I went to a zero-knowledge book club where we learned about GKR, verifier and boolean hypercube domains, proving
correctness, witness and verifier and role of interactive proof in the system (we don't need one; we can get
multiprover interactive proof, probabilistically checkable proof), and are going into cryptographic techniques
that turn interactive proofs into snarks next, as well as information theoretic work, IOPs vs MIPs, transformation
into snarks, snarks vs interactive proofs. It's a pretty solid group but it's my first time attending. I look forward
to learning more.
- I also attended and led a seminar, and my internet dropped out for two minutes, but the group was so awesome that
I came back in seamlessly, and they were so patient and engaged in our conversation. So that's awesome. Next week we
have another session on protocols in-depth, but I am not the deputy, which I was this week, so I don't have to go all-out
and make a slideshow and stuff like I did this week. However, you know me..if given the chance.... :)

## Coming up
- I'm travelling next week! I have a bunch of people who have already spoken to me about catching up (or meeting because I've been speaking with them *forever* and they live out there; it's already a bit overwhelming. I also need to possibly pack some extra
podcast stuff because I might end up doing a podcast out there (hi sirens!).
I'm going to try to do what I can while I am there, but I don't know much about how things are going to pan out, and my work comes first.
-  I also found out that next year I'm doing some *crazy* travel, which is kind of scary but
also exciting! I have a few loose ends to tie up, including some research stuff to get done, so we'll see how everything goes!

## And that's it
