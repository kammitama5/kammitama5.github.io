## My first week as a Visiting PhD student!

## I'm not going to do these every week
- So I don't think I'm going to do these every week of course, but certainly, recording my experiences in my first week, I think,
is useful. I got in really late on Sunday, after my flight was delayed to SFO in Detroit, and fifteen minutes before boarding my
bookpack completely split apart and I had to get a new one last-minute and repack in a hot second. It worked out, and even better,
there was an empty seat between myself and another passenger (who took the window seat) for our 5 hour 28 minute trip.
- When I got to SFO, it was late and raining, so I tried to get a Lyft and one kept circling for a while (5 minutes away
then 15, then 28, then 33...thanks tech layoffs!), until I got switched
to another that picked me up within 5 minutes. Once I was settled in, I got up the next day, a little tired, but ready for the first
day.
- I have to say, it's been an incredible experience. It started with our being welcomed to the first week of our Error-Correcting
codes bootcamp, and it took me a good five minutes to realize it was [Shafi Goldwasser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi_Goldwasser) herself welcoming us,
and my mind suddenly
thought "no way. That's Shafi!", as I had only really ever seen her speak, and not in-person, and there she was, 3 feet in front of me,
saying "Welcome Fellows". If ever I think back to times where I wondered if I had made the right choice coming to grad school,
I think this experience alone justified it lol.
I checked in, so warmly welcomed by the people with whom I had been conversing for several months now, and they gave me a package
of a t-shirt and cup, and told me about getting my student ID. During our first lunch break, I was not only able to grab lunch,
but to also get my student ID pretty quickly. This was useful because any access to the building to work outside of the typical hours
meant I would need a card to get in.
- Within the first week, we were given the opportunity to sit in on a Berkeley professor's Coding Theory class, which was starting that
Wednesday, I got to give a speed talk (which was well-received! A lot of people said I gave them a lot to think about, and that
I was a good speaker, which was surprising given how nervous I felt throughout the entire break before the talks), meet some incredibly
kind and fun people who are at the top of the field, have access to a fantastic and collaborative space with any and all the
amenities I could possibly need, go out for lunch each day with old and new friends, explore the campus and talk to undergrads
about the different clubs on campus, engage in several receptions with faculty from all over the world, meet postdocs and other
visiting scientists in my area (I have never seen so many overleafs open on screens in my life!), experience my first happy hour
open problem session, in which there was food and drink, but also, people were working on problems, and finally, go out to
happy hour with friends from the workshop..all in the first week.

## My assessment
- I've been trying to process everything, and how wonderful this experience has been in only the first week of being here,
and one of the things that immediately comes to mind is how organic it feels to just do work here. I feel like I have all
the things I need to be supported to do actual work, which feels...strange, but for the first time, "comfortable" (if that
is the right word to use).
- I honestly don't feel like going to conferences, or that sort of stuff as much as I do just going to the lab and getting
work done, because it just is the kind of space where I've felt (at least so far) I could be really productive and I have
all the things I need to do what I came to grad school to do. And it also feels a bit bittersweet that I didn't really
feel like I had that as much before. I had a realization sometime during the week where I thought "oh, so this is what
it feels like to be supported." It all feels so comfortable, and foreign at the same time.

## So
- While I'm here, I'm making the most out of everything; it's just been so fantastic, and I'm so thankful and happy
to have had the opportunity to be here!

Beautiful buildings though!

- So awesome! I had a thought this week where I was like "well, maybe I should just do visiting positions for the rest
of grad school" lol

- We went out for Happy Hour at the end of the first week, after the open problems reception, and I saw this! It warmed
my heart because clearly someone was in the know about my country, and that we make Angostura bitters lol.


## And that's it!
