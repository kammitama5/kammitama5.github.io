## RustReach First Meeting

## Finally back in LA

- I got back into LA last night around 11pm. Got to sleep around 2am.
- I watched ```the Disaster Artist``` on the plane. Totally good movie. I laughed out loud.
  It's also pretty smart, and is very tongue-in-cheek, which I really liked. 
- I had a really great time on my trip (which I can't speak much about..sorry).
  All I can say is that I met some really smart people and saw a lot of Maths.
  It sort of cemented in my mind that I'm seriously considering the East Coast.
  I can't say I've really *fit* out here. It's a bit frustrating, and I've ended up
  shying away and just dealing with specific groups of people or none at all.
  That wasn't my experience when I was briefly on the other coast. I liked the people
  there a lot. I think we have a lot more in common, and I like the pace and work ethic
  over there. I like their straight up demeanor, because that's pretty much how I am.
  People actually laugh at my jokes over there; I've been told I have a very specific
  sense of humour. I've found that JPL-ers also like my jokes or get my sense of humour,
  which is nice. I've also been told that they too have a specific sense of humour (it's true!).
- Where I was has very much a mindset of "pull yourself up from the bootstraps" in terms of mentality,
  and making things. I *loved* that. It's very much what I think of when I think of ```American values```.
  Or immigrant, which is what I am. I sat next to a welder for part of my flight. I really enjoyed
  speaking with him. He was cool AF. I took two welding classes, and was seriously considering getting
  my license a few years ago (just as a skill-set), and my teacher was a dive-welder (and female, too...
  she was *very much* a badarse). I just had a great experience. 
- I knocked out and got up around 10am. I don't think I've slept that 
  long in a while. It was a bit nice, but really weirded me out when I saw
  the time.
  
## At 1pm
- Okay, so I had *no* idea that Slack had video conferencing as an option. Wut?
- I have two main laptops; one is for working (Linux) and the other is 
  for general personal stuff (Windows). The other personal stuff is 
  capable of running things like Cloud9 if I need a linux console for a workshop
  and I don't need that much space (say, a one-day workshop that isn't Android
  or something). However, it has limited space. So if I have Slack and am watching
  listening to music in the background and writing emails, the browser might crash.
- So yeah..that's interesting. However, it forces me to streamline the chatter in 
  my life, and just focus on work, which is good. So one thing at a time, and 
  I don't get distracted once I've sat down to work. 
- Anyways, I met with Aaron, my RustReach mentor, and he was quite wonderful. My task for this week
  is to go through the ```cargo book```.
  You can find it [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/faq.html).
  I was able to complete that today, but I found the list of Rust's Compiler Errors
  [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html). So I'll be reading that 
  until the wee hours of the morning. 
- The Rust community is pretty great. I've interacted with them before. No complaints.

## Tomorrow
- I'm working on CodeWorld, because today was also a bit of my day of rest (see the AM
  sleep-out). I was able to work out my schedule so that I spend around (on average)
  53 hours on CodeWorld a week (not including meetings online with my mentors).
  
## I'm also really excited
- To spend part of this summer working on Racket. I really think it will make me a stronger
  programmer. I really appreciated that after I signed up, one of the actual professors
  wrote us a personal email. Really nice touch. I'm particularly looking for sort 
  of interaction in a PhD programme. I don't do well at places with hundreds of people.
  I get really burnt out. So I think my mentor guided me to make the best choice.

## This week
- Is my last real week of sort of goofing off before my mentor can officially kill me.
  I can still manage to put in the time for this week (around 40 hours), but from next week,
  I'm officially GSoC's and Mozilla's. I won't reveal much but there will be a fair amount 
  of fun this week, and I'll be sure to take pics (if I can) and post about it!
  
## And that's it for now!
