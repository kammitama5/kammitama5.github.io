## The Arithmeum and LaTeX

## LaTeX
- I spent my time this week mostly learning [sTeX](https://github.com/slatex/sTeX/blob/main/doc/stex-manual.pdf) and [Naproche](https://naproche.github.io/). In sTeX, you can write symbolic annotations in your proofs. This is really helpful
if you want to ensure that you understand a paper, follow a proof, etc.
- I wrote a couple toy proofs but I can probably write a longer, more serious post soon about my experience.
- I also learned a bit of Naproche, which is this other cool system that allows you to formally verify LaTeX proofs.
- So think of it as one tool for annotating symbolic notation in LaTeX so that someone can hover over the proofs and gain
more information, and the other for writing papers and formally verifying proofs written in LaTeX. Both so useful and
I had heard of neither tool before this week, but especially as I'll be writing more Maths papers, I'm seriously planning
on investing in these tools, for my own learning, and also as I continue to learn Lean.

## Arithmeum
- I went with a friend from the workshop also to the Arithmeum. The museum has a number of calculating machines, as well
as an Enigma, which was a treat!
- I ate currywurst in Los Angeles with some German friends (actually, it was in either Huntington beach), but I've really
enjoyed the sauces in currywurst more here. It's just so good, I've been binging on this very unhealthy food :)

- My friend Beethoven in the lights. I joked that he has hair like me :) What an inspiration!

## So good!
- I've loved every minute of my time here. A new friend of mine (from the workshop that I've been eating lunch with,
walking home with, going sightseeing with) convinced me that I should visit Berlin, too! She said it sounds like I'd love it! We spent the evening with a large group of 14 people eating Indian food; it was so good! It was the first time
I really got to chat with Professor Davenport, also; he is a riot and just a wonderful person! A group of us walked back home and chatted. It's just been such a positive experience for me! I feel grateful for the experience!

## And that's it
