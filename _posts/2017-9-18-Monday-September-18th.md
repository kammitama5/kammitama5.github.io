## Things to do

- Coding test (done)

- Haskell course start (done with Week 1)

- Continue with C (done with part 1..start on crypto assignment (2 and 3))

- Nanodegree videos finish (rest of week work on)

## Katas

- Format code so matches result

```
def list_animals(animals):
    list = ''
    for i in (animals):
        list += str(animals.index(i)+1) + '. ' + str(i) + '\n'
    
    return list
```

- If there is a gold in the array, return True, else False

```
def check_the_bucket(bucket):
    total = 0
    for i in bucket:
        if i == 'gold':
            total = total + 1
    if total == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```
