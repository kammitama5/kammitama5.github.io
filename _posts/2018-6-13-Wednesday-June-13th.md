## GSoC, RustReach Day 31 and Progress

## I worked until minutes to 3
- I was up until minutes to 3 in the morning working on code, and then took about an hour's nap before heading to work.
  I don't usually drink coffee, but today I had one cup...because I was tired.
  
## However, it seems like things are progressing!
- I got about 6 out of the 26 constructors printed to the screen, and it's actually pretty awesome to see Haskell
  in the Browser. It's so awesome being a part of that.
- My sprint at work had a break in the morning, so I spent the time re-working the types section (chapter 5?) of 
  Haskellbook. It's crazy how much better and easier it is for me to work through now. Weird.
- I think once I get used to working through type errors and composition more, I'll be in much better shape.
  But the whole process is challenging and fun.
 
## A moment to appreciate
- I'm really, really appreciative and satisfied with *all* of my mentors this summer. They've all made a huge
  difference and I'm really thankful. Chris moved across the country, and still maintained a schedule at all hours
  so that if I needed help, he could help me. Gabe just came back from Zurich and is dead tired, but has invested *so*
  much into helping me. And these people have jobs, maintain libraries and have lives. I don't know how they do it.
  So I'm really thankful they're just good, solid people. Aaron, my Rust mentor, is also really solid. So, I've mostly
  been going through the Rust book, so I'm not doing the flailing thing yet, but I'm confident when I do, he'll be there
  to assist.
- I've been on the *other* side of mentoring (as a mentor) virtually, but it really does take a certain type of person to
  be a good mentor. Having empathy and patience. I've just been really impressed by how positive and how much *great* advice
  I've gotten from everyone.
- The programming community (well, Rust is pretty friendly, but the Haskell community *does* have some rotten apples) isn't
  always the friendliest because you get all sorts, but my mentors have really done a great job at shielding me from
  negativity so I have a great experience, and being a source of support for me. In turn, it's really helped me to mature
  and see the forest for the trees. And I'm super thankful for that.
  
## What I'd like
- I'd like to continue working with Haskell however I can. I realized that an opportunity I thought was set up as "open
  source" was really not that at all, but there are other options, so I'll keep contributing to my GSoC and RustReach
  projects moving forward, and continue to look for opportunities to commit code.
- For GSoC, I'd like to definitely stick it through the end so my organization gets money. I'd like them to be chosen next year,
  too, so more people can get an opportunity to work on Haskell. GSoC has been a great opportunity. 
- For Rust, the community seems particularly friendly; I'd like to continue to be a part of that community, also.

## I'm going to PLDI
- I was chosen as both a student volunteer *and* a scholarship recipient for PLMW. So I'm excited about attending. Plus,
  it's in Philly, and Ben said he'd be there. I'm not sure if I mentioned I had been helping him get contacts for some
  research a while ago. Since he's at UPenn, it's easy for him to get to PLDI, and it would be a nice opportunity to catch
  up. He's a *really* nice guy in person! Gabe said he went to school there and he hadn't met him, and I here I am, on the
  other side of the country, chatting with the guy LOL.
  
## Anyways, I'm burning out
- Tomorrow, I'm going to try to get the points Constructors (eg those that require points) to work and be seen in the
  browser
- I also plan on spending Friday morning and Saturday on Rust, since Fridays are off for me :D
- Also, I have that Medium article to write.

## And that's it!
