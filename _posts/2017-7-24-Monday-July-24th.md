## Change of winds

## A change of plans

- Firstly, we got our authentication to work! So we can "log in"!
  
- Secondly, I'm not going to DEF CON. My group needs me so I guess I'll
  have to wait until next year. No biggie..there is always next year! 
  Plus, I can stay for longer.
  
## That being said

- I met a few new people who sail out of Dana Point, and they were 
  wonderful! We chartered a Catalina (boat) this Sunday, and sailed for 7 hours
  straight. It was epic!
  
- It was very familiar to me, like a Hunter, so it felt like second-nature 
  to walk around and pull the mains, etc. 
  
- This group regularly goes to Catalina, so I may do that sometime soon!
  (probably in December)

## Short term this week

- So I got everything I was supposed to get done this weekend,
  and am working on 
  - making Slides for Presentation (today mostly)
  - Deploying app to Heroku (rest of the week and Saturday)
  
- Since I won't be going to DEF CON, I'm able to meet up with
  my group Friday and Saturday. So that gives me more time.
  
  
- I'm still going to SF on Wednesday, though. 
  I'm thinking about that interviewing event. I guess I should go.
  However, they said something about "diversity talk", and I'm not
  too keen on that sort of stuff. I just want to focus on coding
  and interviewing right now. Especially when it takes about two hours
  to get there. So we'll see.
  
## But what about your Nanodegree work?

- Yeah, sadly I may not get around to that this week, but I'll try..maybe
  near the end of the week, to put in some work on that. 
  However, this week is mostly geared towards my group / team project.
