## Voyager event and Beer! 

- Spent last night at this cool event on 40 years of Voyager!

- It was wonderful! 

- They showed us photos of Ed Stone's notebooks, in which he took his first
  notes for what they needed for Voyager 1!

- It was heavy on the data analysis, which was *heaven* for me. 
  It was also highly interesting and I learned quite a bit about Voyager.
  My mentor worked on Voyager.
  
- I didn't know that AU was astronomical units. 

- Voyager is also losing about 4 watts of power per year.
  
## Things that I found really interesting! 

- Voyager trajectory was based on an alignment that only occurs every 176 years.

- [The Yarkovsky Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect).

- Retrograde vs prograde

- Voyager was originally called MJS; Mariner Jupter Saturn.

- Io as a moon looks quite different from our own Moon! 

- Didn't know much about [Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(moon)) before.

- The Solar cycle is every 11 years; the poles of the Sun change then, 
  so the poles point North again (do a 360) in 22 years or so.
  
- The Poles of Neptune and Uranus are fascinating! 
  It is influenced by their axial tilt. There is still a lot
  debate of which way is North.
  
- There is a boundary of interstellar space that the scientists had to listen
  out for, called the Heliopause; the boundary where the Solar System ends.
  There was some debate over when this was reached, or if it has been
  reached. See [Voyager Captures Sounds of Interstellar Plasma in Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF7N8uhWGXM)
  
- The concept of Solar gravitational deflection that protects planets in that bubble
  from direct interaction with comets, etc.
  
- Here is a lecture courtesy NASA entitled [Voyager 1 is in Interstellar Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ddt8xnnGGA).
  
## Other concepts

- Shapiro's Delay

## They also gave out some commemorative pins!

- It says "Voyager...40 Years..1977 to 2017", NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory!

- Unexpected, and pretty neat. Also post-cards and bookmarks.

- I'm probably going to give mine to my mom, since my dad is in Barbados 
  until December, so it would be a surprise to her if she got a Postcard 
  in between that time :)
  
## We went out for drinks!

- My mentor, his brother (who also used to work at JPL), and two other persons,
 (one of whom was the Project Manager for Voyager; John Casani) went out for drinks
 at the favourite British pub of JPL-ers. 
 
- It was really fun! John told us that when he went to UPenn as a student, one 
  of his summer project included disassembling the [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC).
  
- He admitted he hadn't been to the Computer History Museum, so we insisted that he not only visit,
  but also told him about the Babbage Machine!
  
## Conclusion

- I got home at 11pm, but was it was so worth it!

## Things to complete this weekend

- Programme for Nanodegree project (Sunday)
- Application (Sunday)
- Mathematica work (Friday to next Friday)

- I also was able to book my trip to San Jose for this Data Science workshop,
  so that's all set for October!
