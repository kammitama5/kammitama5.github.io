## Making a language

## I took a class
- I took a [class](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/language-construction-workshop/26) taught by this amazing [software engineer and linguist](https://colingorrie.com/about) where we made a language in six weeks. 
- Then, we presented our translation of the same poem based on the language by reading it if we wanted.
- Mine is inspired by Hindi and Armenian and is [VSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object). Other VSO languages are  Irish, Mayan and some other Polynesian languages. I haven't come up with a name for the language yet.
- I wanted to make a language for a game I'm making (along with some game art. Don't tease my geekiness lol.
- This was *such* a fun class!! I loved it!!! I'm also taking an Esoteric Programming languages class in 2021.

## Poem
```
On a hill, a sheep that did not 
have wool saw horses.
kŋ <ng> kaa tshaa-ŋ-aŋ 
tsaani tschaa saat-o kaabkh-i

One horse pulled a heavy wagon.
ŋ <ng> tsc aa-o u-ŋ kaabkh tschgaa

One horse carried a big load.
ŋ <ng> tsc aa-o u-ŋ aa-tng-ak vtkaa zaa-k

One horse carried a person.
ŋ <ng> tsc aa-o u-ŋ aa-tng-ak pvkka

The sheep said to the horses:
kah-ao (pl) tschaak a-k kaabkh-i

“I grieve when I see a person
who drives horses.”
ŋ <ng> ŋklhhh saat-ak 
brt-ŋ kaabkh(-an)-i pvkka

The horses said:
kaa-o kaabkh(-an)-i

We grieve when we see this:
ŋ <ng>-o ŋklhhh saat-o

"A person takes the wool of the sheep
and makes a warm garment with it.
trrda pvkka tschaa-tsaani t-a-k-b-r̥
kvtaa ŋ-ts-z-a tshaa

And the sheep does not have wool."
tsaani tschaa aa-tk ŋ-aŋ

When the sheep heard this, it fled
into the plain.
ŋ-k-lhhh tch-aa-r̥-tch-o kah-ao (pl)
ŋ rrh udvnn ŋ <ng> khh
```

## That's it
