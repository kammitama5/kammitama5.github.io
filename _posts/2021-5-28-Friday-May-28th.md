## Mentors : Dr. Gladys West

## I was chosen as 1 of 2 students
- Today, I was chosen as 1 of 2 students to say words of Congratulations to Dr. Gladys West, for her NCWIT Pioneer in Tech Award.
- I kid you not, as I was listening to Dr. West talk about her life and accomplishments, I had to wipe a tear away. She is SO INSPIRING,
and humble, and persistent. I was so honoured to get to speak with her today. This memory will stay with me for the rest of my life.

## Who is Dr. Gladys West
- Her Mathematical models are integral to the development of GPS. You can read more about her [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_West).
- For many years, she thought her work was unremarkable, even though she has been incredibly hardworking, and broke so many barriers. Her work was rediscovered
and celebrated, and she was selected by BBC as one of the 100 Women of 2018. For many years, she was a hidden figure, but her remarkable and pioneering work has 
fortunately been celebrated all over the world. Her contributions are invaluable.

## What's next?
- I have work to do for research, so I'm probably going to do that later this evening, and then work on my MSR work this weekend, too.
- But for now, I just feel really grateful, and happy. Part of my congratulations and a bit about me, as I was introduced to Dr. Gladys as one of two 
special persons that she had to meet, was to mention that a mathematician who works in using satellite remote sensing is one who encouraged me to grad school.
Even when I was being offered opportunities to go to work, he said adamantly, "you should still get your degree and go to grad school", and I am super thankful
for that. Who could have imagined all of these opportunities and experiences along the way? I could have never; not beyond my wildest dreams.
Dr. Gladys West is a person who viscerally expresses her gratitude and emotions, and it was so unexpected to see her so impacted by the words of congratulations.
I'm so thankful!

## But for now, that's about it
