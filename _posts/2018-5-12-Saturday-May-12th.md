## NgGirls and a post before napping

## I'm about to take a nap...
- I came back from Mountain View around 6am, and finally unpacked and am heading to sleep.
- I have a meeting at 1pm with my mentor in Dublin
- I also have to meet my mentor at JPL for 6pm to see a Jazz show, part of which includes the Caltech jazz band :D

## Yesterday was amazing!
- I was one of 90 women chosen for Ng Girls, which is the workshop in the spirit of Django Girls, where we have mentors
  and work through learning Angular via a tutorial together. 
- I met some really amazing and supportive women. I was amazed that they saw me as really resourceful, and one of the senior
  engineers / mentors said that I was already doing really well, and to continue. I left feeling really energized. 
  I hope to continue to stay in touch with these ladies; they were a pleasure to interact with and work with yesterday.
  
## I then found a coffee shop
- So during the workshop, we figured out that this particular coffee shop on Castro had "great wifi", so I settled down
  around 6pm and started testing out the video chat for my 7pm meeting. Except, the wifi kept dropping. So within 20 
  minutes, I ended up finding a nearby Peet's and settled down there. Much better wifi and the video call with my GSoC
  mentor was fine.
- In fact, it was great

## Things we got done
- We were able to fix a ```-Werror``` in ```CollaborationUI.hs``` that was aborting the build, and also get a clean install after 
  fixing some previous errors like a colliding ```error``` in our modules (so we hid one) and match the otherwise case 
  in an exhaustive pattern match. I have to push these changes to github and then make a pull request.
  
- Tomorrow, I also hope to work on some Rust (based on feedback today and the task to perform this week via the 1pm meeting)
  and start working on the ```solidPolygon``` implementation function in ```Driver.hs``` so that it type checks.
  
## And that's about it!
- Nap time! :D
