## The Future we Imagine

## I've been thinking about the future for years
- Before I ever thought about getting into Computer Science, I was drawn to film because of the technology,
  the vision of what it represented. I still think it's such a powerful medium; it can erase truth, expose truth,
  subvert commonly accepted beliefs or awaken a sleeping population. 
- After I got bored with following the gear heads in the Film industry (updates in cameras, 
  just like updates in software libraries don't really interest me), I was interested in Concept Design.
  Concept Design is essentially the iterative process of designing movies. Unfortunately, these days, it's 
  kind of a mindless, superficial industry in terms of its ideas (and a lot of those artists don't read), but I was drawn to the idea of using hidden
  messages in the design and fabrication of a movie to spread a broader message about not just the society we
  currently live in, but the society we *could* live in.
- At its best, it's like an opportunity to tell a moralalistic tale through a design image.
  
## The Medium of Computer Science
- One of the reasons I think that the field of Machine Learning is so interesting is that it again forces us
  to ask these questions that came up in my film theory classes. Who owns the image, who profits from our indulgence
  in these images, what are these images really saying? It's an interesting question to ask if we extrapolate these
  questions to data.
  
## The most interesting Concept Design
- The most interesting concept design classes I ever had were some of the worldbuilding ones. Specifically, they were
  based around *ideas*. What if the characters lived in a world of depleted resources, but in the future? What would
  be the currency of the future, given this constraint? What would forms of energy look like? What would houses and
  infrastructure look like? These questions are so applicable to the field of AI today. 
- What's unfortunate is that they're so applicable but I never have anyone to TALK TO about these things. The film
  people aren't particularly interested in AI (they're too busy looking at new cameras!) and the AI people don't particularly
  see the value of critical film theory. I don't know if they've quite figured out the connection between the two just yet.
- Some of the most interesting classes I ever took acknowledged that there were inequalities (just as there are today)
  that are economic, racial etc and that these inequalities would still be embedded in societies in the future; they would
  just be represented differently. And some of the most interesting teachers actively told us to subvert the expectation
  of these ideas in our design pitches; why not have a black lead; Hollywood doesn't have that. 
- Alas, unfortunately the most *interesting* work typically came from the very students who were exposed to and very aware
  of such inequalities (either through lived experiences or otherwise), but their survival in that field was difficult, because it rewards those who already have a safety
  net that involved nepotism and generational wealth. It rewarded those designers in learning who could pay the high 
  tuition without blinking and saw design as little more than flashy colours in Photoshop and fancy brushes, adding a filter
  bloom here and there, with a radial blur. Having seen behind the curtain of Hollywood, I'm perpetually underwhelmed by the 
  lack of new ideas and critical thought, but now I understand *why* that is the case. 
  
## I'm thinking about this stuff
- I've been thinking a lot about this kind of stuff in the context not of just what is going on in the world, but in terms
  of representation.

- Years ago, I made this image in concept design class. It's one of the few I ever kept, and I always had a sense of humour about work in that world, because I often thought that a lot of the work was pretty but shallow. The title was an inside joke about sequels. I guess I kept it because I liked the idea
  of a lead character who was represented by a group that wasn't typical (that is, an elderly person), frail, but whose
  technology empowered him. In this case, it was this sort of futuristic breathing device. It's still a bit of a strange image
  because it's a fake movie poster.
- Especially in grad school, though, it's very typical to hear students over and over think aloud about themselves, but not
  groups like the elderly. The typical researcher in Computer Science isn't rushing to publish in NeurIPS on AI for the elderly.
  Maybe there should be a track that specifically considers the ways AI might harm this particularly vulnerable group, and ways
  to mitiage those risks. But what do I know? I'm just learning.
  
## Today I feel grateful
- I have a long way to go, but I feel like coming with my background, and having been exposed to these ideas, and learning
  Computer Science research, I'm painfully aware of a lack of these perspectives. I've often said that most of the time,
  I feel like I'm an impostor. Not just by virtue of the way I look in these halls, but I think that having a curiosity 
  for the field might just *not be enough*. I'm often afraid that the gatekeepers will discover me and deem me not worthy.
- However, that curiosity I had, that imagination for what the future *might* look like, really keeps me going. What if we
  did the right things to mitigate all the bad things that might happen? It's exciting. 
  
## Wanting to make the world a better place
- Many children, when asked what they want to do when they grow up, often talk about making the world a better place. 
  In my generation, a popular answer was "World Peace". In my mom's generation, it was "by being a nurse, doctor, or some
  professional in the medical field". I've heard from a Concept Designer professor that in his time, "everyone wanted to be
  a marine biologist" (that really was a generational thing; you see these in waves growing up, and it's dependent on when
  you grew up!). 
- Perhaps it's better to have a different view on that; which is that, you can be whatever you like, do whatever you like,
  and impact the world through change by lived experience; seeing the world for what it is, interacting with others 
  and understanding that there are things that even you who wanted to be a marine biologist just don't know, but can work
  with others to figure out. Maybe in the end that's really what will "make the world a better place". Lived Experience. 
  Empathy.
  
## And that's it
