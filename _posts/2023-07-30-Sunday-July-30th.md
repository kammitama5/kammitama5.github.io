## Quantum Summer Ghost Tour

## First Ghost Tour
- I went to my first ghost tour! Part of it was history of Park City, and the other part was ghost stories!
- I went with my friends Lia and Sarah, and it was really fun. We ended up eating dinner, then doing ghost tour, and then walking home
close to midnight, after having stopped at a local bar to drink some beer and talk about deadlines and submissions for an upcoming quantum
conference, as well as things like postdocs, travelling, etc. It was very fun!

## Photos

- You should probably take the tour yourself, so I will not spare the commentary on it.

## TIL
- Dimes are made of Silver, which is from Utah.
- Utah has manufacturing for tech, and has a rich history of (i) silver (ii) coal-mining.

## Sleep time!
- We're all really excited to see this one particular lecturer who discusses quantum complexity theory! Looking forward to those lectures this week!
