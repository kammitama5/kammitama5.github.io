## The Decade of Taking Risks (It was)

## Plans
- People have spent a lot of time talking about what they plan to do in the coming year, or decade.
  For some, it's a decade of reflection. Instead, I feel incredible gratitude for this past decade of having
  taken risks, and eventually coming to a place where it's finally begun to pay off. It feels great.
  
## The Beginning
- Risk-taking is in my blood. My dad often told me he didn't know where I got that from, because I always seemed
  to have no problem throwing everything away and starting all over again, if I thought that it was worth it.
  Throw away everything but a suitcase and move. Chase the courage of your conviction. That's me. 
  Move from a comfortable, tropical island to snowy upstate New York, to a school with a minority population of less than 5%.
  Do it again in 2019.
- A decade ago, I had moved from Upstate New York, to Los Angeles, knowing only one person who would be
  my roommate for three years, who was at the time crashing on the couch of another person who was our mutual
  friend. I knew no one there, but I determined that I would make friends and set up a network there. In ten days of having
  moved there, I started my first job at 9.25 dollars an hour, as a camera technician for film and video cameras, 
  on a student visa. I was hired
  because I was the only one they said who knew how to thread a specific film camera, the one of 14.5 frame specificity.
- Years later, after friends have moved, and I just moved (in mid-August) to Vermont, I think about the many adventures
  and risks I took out there. I worked on a bunch of films (close to 200), plays, made art, was in an Art show
  put on the by Art Directors' Guild, took classes in sculpture, 3D modelling, concept design, figure drawing, painting, welding, machining, studied architecture
  and made models out of wood and arylic, joined a bunch of hackerspaces, 
  learned how to sail, made friends with a bunch of NASA scientists, 
  taught robotics classes, got my green card and somehow ended up deciding I wanted to become a computer scientist, 
  because it was the way I thought I could make an impact on the world  and grow in a selfless way over these next few years. It was fun, wild ride and I don't
  regret anything.
- A year ago, I was at a Programming Languages conference I was given a scholarship to attend, and the group of my peers
  quite enjoyed my charisma. Someone noticed my badge, and subtly mentioned it to the group. 
  I believe it might have been their goal to embarrass me or knock me down a few. At the time, anyone who had
  read it might want to know how I fit there, and what would be my path to grad school. It got back to the group and 
  they looked at me in shock
  and asked me "what are you going to do? We're here because the next logical step for all of us is grad school. How will
  you do that? What will you do?". 
  I looked at them and said calmly "I am going to apply to grad school, of course. Let the school decide, but I want to attend". 
  In my mind, we were all there for that, including myself. I resolved to do this.
  
## A friend of mine passed
- A friend of mine passed away this weekend. He was loved by millions of people. I thought about one of the last
  posts he made; he was always creating things; and how many people responded to the thing he had *just* made that
  he decided to share with us on his personal social media account. He was able to bring so much joy to people.
  I thought about a comment someone made about his work; he wasn't called a designer, but a "world builder". 
  It brought me back to a class I once took with another famous designer and friend who instructed us to be 
  "world builders". That's always stuck with me. Whatever you make, however you see the future, think about the 
  different things that intersect that make up that world, because nothing exists in isolation; there is an eco-system
  that is affected by everything we design, everything we make, everything we do. 
- I think about this a lot today, as someone who plans to spend the rest of my career in computer science, as a  
  computer scientist. A social computer scientist, who wants to make the world better, with other people, and not
  *for* other people (or rather, not with the assumption that I come knowing everything, bearing all the knowledge).
  
## Be Bold
- I spent this Christmas season back in New York (in true full-circle), and a designer/professor friend of mine
  told me "I'm so proud of you...I have always thought you belong to everyone..you are not to belong in one group".
  Throughout all of these experiences, I've been an outcast, or rather, someone who has floated from group to group,
  not quite fitting in, and taking the roads a lot my peers didn't take. They were puzzled. Why aren't you doing...
  what everyone else is doing? 
- I took a lighting design class in Undergrad in which one of my professors told us "whatever choice you make, be 
  bold about it". I always remember those words, but in reality, it's hard. It's difficult to swim against the tide.
  For years, it's been a struggle. I've been swimming against the tide for this past decade.
  It's been finally a few years into feeling like it's finally been paying off, and it feels really great.
  
## Happy New Year to all of you
- I have a list of goals, but I guess I'll keep that to myself. They mostly involve things I'd like to focus on making
  and doing this year, particularly as they pertain to becoming a computer scientist and researcher. But I'd like to focus
  on the *Happy* part of the New Year. May you be Happy. May you share that happiness with others and encourage them to
  take risks, and find their happiness, and to share that with others.
  
## And that's it
