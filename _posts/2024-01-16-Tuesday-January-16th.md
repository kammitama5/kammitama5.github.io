## Photos from Above

## I just wanted to post some photos from my trip
- I've been taking these for years every time I am returning back to the United States (I think in my first year of undergrad,
one such photo was the screensaver for my laptop), but people have now only begun telling me they find them to be pretty,
so I guess why not.
- What's cool is that for years I used to take photos of them when going back and forth with an Olympus camera or a Sony
Cybershot camera, but I'm currently using my first smart phone ever (thanks first-internship at fruit company!) and realized
it was geolocating what the different places were, which was cool.
- So some of them are tagged Turks and Caicos and things like that on my actual phone, which is cool. Speaking of smart phones
during the break, I saw the video in which Matt Parker found a bug in the iCalendar and found it amusing. It's called "Why is
Apple Calendar so broken?" [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER1a6jgW1Gs). On my phone at least, it seems to be fixed,
but I love that kind of stuff; I find it to be very fun. His channel is pretty cool in any case.
- Anyways, back to work for me.
