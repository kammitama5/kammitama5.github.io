## A Workshop for Women in Number Theory!

## I am sitting in a lobby
- I thought I might post these, as I have a bit of time before my shuttle arrives to the airport.
- I had an incredible time, first with the email that said that I had been accepted to this year's WIN! Secondly, in realizing that my booked ride
in Burlington didn't show up after 10 minutes. This resulted in my texting my Maths advisor, and in her picking me up five minutes later, and telling
me to have fun, but also to "be careful, because it's a pretty wild time!". I didn't know what to expect, but it exceeded my expectations!
- It is the ideal mindset and space to do research. Everyone is incredibly wonderful, and it is really just the community to grow as a junior 
researcher, while being mentored by senior researchers. And with luck, I was mentored by one of the founders of the group, and of the event!
- The event started to encourage these kinds of collaboration and research, because as one of the co-founders mentioned, it was found in studies that
"men invite men to speak at conferences, and women invite both men and women". I was so happy to be there, because it felt like everyone was taking
the time to invest in you.
- I mentioned to one person that I couldn't believe I had gotten in, and she mentioned that she had applied at every occasion during grad school,
but only got in as a postdoc, so that I must indeed be a special person. That warmed my heart, as did so many interactions this week. It was such
a positive space for me!
- My mentors, as one mathematician said about one of my mentors, who was her mentor years ago, "believed in you so much". I felt so supported here!


## Social
- We had one afternoon free, so I chose to go to the hot springs with three other ladies. It was wonderful!
- Some of the other groups went cross-country skiing and took gondola trips or went to Lake Louise and whatnot.
- And would you believe our group had so much energy that after some people went skiing, we still worked until after 11pm that night!?
- It was really such an energizing space to be in; I enjoyed my time and my group so much!

## Work
- We are advised not to speak about what we are working on until it is published, but we worked on a lot! Pretty much, it could be about 4 papers
in the making. We also will plan at the least to publish in the proceedings for the workshop, too!
- Our group was unique in that we had two Computer Scientists and Two mathematicians and a remote Computer Scientist who is a mentee of one of our mentors / works with her (and is leaving to start grad school!). Our skillset was very unique, as will be the work we publish!
- Basically, we will keep working weekly on what we started this week, and as we publish (earliest summer), we also plan to continue working on the
other projects / spinoffs we initiated at the group. Also, stay tuned for a possible trip, too related to this! (during summer!)

## Photos
- The food was exceptional, but so was everything about my stay. I'm so thankful and happy I was able to attend!
