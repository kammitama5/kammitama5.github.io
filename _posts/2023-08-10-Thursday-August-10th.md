## GREPSEC and SOUPS 2023

## I am so tired
- I did the thing where you travel from one part of the United States to the next, and am pretty tired. I already have a bunch of meetings
and things to get done, but I would like to spend some time tomorrow afternoon just resting, because I haven't really had time off in a while.
So we'll see how that goes. I'm really just doing my best right now.

## I went to GREPSEC and SOUPS this week!
- GREPSEC is meant as a mentorship workshop with talks that range on everything from privacy, security, usability, programming languages, etc. I
even met someone who was working on adversarial models for AI, so there's that kind of work, too! (in fact, the Distinguished Usenix paper this year
was on Glaze, the watermarking mechanism for AI art).
The participants (apparently a LOT of people applied!) ranged from persons working at the intersection of HCI and privacy, security, cryptography,
and a number of things like that, so it was a pretty awesome experience. There were also break-out sessions that discussed topics like how to
deal with paper rejections, and about the academic or industry market, and we also had speed-mentoring sessions, which ranged from switching every
five minutes to a new mentor, or 20 minutes! All were incredibly great. I even attended a talk at GREPSEC where the speaker basically (it was
relayed to me by a friend) told me that a question I asked and some observations I made should be a paper, and the speaker gave me references
and other papers to look at. I think I just need to start a lab because I feel like I always have too many directions for ideas of things to do,
and I can't do them all. Maybe one day! And it would be nice to see students who are interested sort of run with those ideas or modify them
or do experimentation, etc. We shall see.
- One of the quotes I wrote down is that "security is the control of information, and therefore power"
- We also had the opportunity to also attend SOUPS, so I did that also, and all the talks were so interesting! There was also a session after
grepsec / soups on prism, which is focused on security and privacy for vulnerable populations. This was also really interesting, and was headed
by a gentleman who gave the first keynote at GREPSEC, and I really enjoyed his talk!
- In terms of the people, they were all really nice and I think I was notified that I added over 20 people just this week to my network, because I just met
so many amazing people. What I liked is that it also justified for me that there is important work being done at these sorts of intersections
that I think about a lot, coming from certain environments.
- Through the mentorship, I also got a lot of affirmation that I can publish across related fields. In the past, I've gotten some backlash /
gatekeeping for even suggesting that, but I realize now that that is just insecurity by usually other grad students (and that's on them).
Professors publish across fields all the time, and they are no less worthy in one field versus the other. I liked the way one professor put it,
which is that she just likes to pursue interesting problems. I feel the same, and I really dislike the whole "stay in your lane" vibe, which
usually is more of an "insecure grad student" vibe, so as a professor advised "is it from grad students? Just ignore it!". I have to remind
myself that often it is grad students struggling with who they are, their own insecurities and grappling with a lot of these things in this
space called grad school. It shouldn't affect my excitement or love for a topic.
- I read a really great quote on reddit this week about having the audacity to do things. Sometimes there is insecurity that arises because
a person may feel that if they can't put someone else down to make themselves feel tall, they can't exist in a space. And that's really rotten
because it is at the expense of often an unwilling party; no one wants to be put down by someone else so that that someone can feel better or
show up another person (whatever that means). So the existence of a constant underclass in the lab that that person can point to in their feelings
of ineptitude and say "well, at least I'm not like X person / group" can make for a toxic environment.
- I am of the belief that different people can be good at different things, so writing off a person entirely is not something I have the headspace
for. Savants exist in the world, and persons don't often find the same problems / questions interesting in research.
Also, people can get better at things, too; I thought of all places that research would be the space where getting better at things over
a period of time (I mean, the goal of a PhD is to learn how to become a researcher!) is encouraged. However, it's really surprising and
a bit upsetting how much of the institutional structure is placed on people who give the appearance of just having a knack / talent for it
(which often is the result of having just started earlier or being invested in at an earlier stage / more by faculty, having lineage parents
in academia, etc). Also, the grant structure (all of them; NSF, tech companies) also put initiatives in place that also reward this structure
of succeeding early rather than rewarding say, someone who performs exponentially well as they progress in their journey.
- It was uncanny that that topic came up because I watched "The Hunger Games" for the first time (yeah, I'm one of those people who watches
things years after the hype), and so much of the movie (I haven't read the book yet!) was about this motif of natural talent and the expectation
of success based on things like higher rating, being "good with a bow and arrow", etc. I won't spoil it, but I'm happy that some of those
expectations were also broken, too, in the movie; it wasn't a cut and dry case that the only person who was expected early-on to succeed did,
and I think that's very much like the PhD journey. You're flipping a coin on who will be a great researcher, on some level, in spite of various
indicators at the beginning of the journey. So it brings into question how we are even evaluating people early on.
- Anyways, I think I stumbled upon a documentary about Slash (yes, the guitarist) this week, and he was not into
guitar until he found a path to it, and then, as he said "that was it". That can often happen for a person, and seeing a person discover that
is really a beautiful thing, and it definitely may not "come early".

## Tired
- I am pretty tired right now, and have a number of things in the works. Right now, I'm just doing my best, but over the next few days,
there should be a degree of normalcy as I sort things out before heading out again.

## And that's it
