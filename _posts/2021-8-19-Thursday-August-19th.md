## The most amazing conference. My first CRYPTO

## First experiences and Goodbyes
- This week, I attended CRYPTO for the first time. My summer workshop was actually shut down this week (or on a break) because many of the participants
were also present, with some presenting papers, too!
- I attended [MathCrypt](http://lab.algonics.net/temp/mathcrypt/mathcrypt.html), which was *amazing*, with many participants from my new field of study.
- I also gave two talks at my SFPC class; one on Twitch and the other for our last class, specifically on my focus for my PhD and thesis. There's still a lot
I do have to learn, and that is what I'll be doing with this upcoming semester, and Spring. I've already written a proposal, but there is foundational work that
I'm getting up to speed on, via my advisor, who is in Pure Mathematics. And I'm super excited. 

## The photo from IC3
- I'm apparently on the [IC3 website](https://www.initc3.org/events/2021-07-25-ic3-blockchain-summer-camp), for the project we worked on which was chosen as one of the top 4 projects! Check it out! 

## The hack
- A bunch of us were hugely into the crossword puzzle, which was available until Wednesday.
- I got up to the 13th place! I'm proud of that, considering how many crazy smart people were participating. At my highest score, I got around 185 out of 196.
- So the highest *honest* score one could achieve is 196, and after that, you are ranked based on your number of incorrect guesses!
- I later got bumped down to about 20th once people started getting really competitive and hacking the board or using automated solvers and stuff like that.
- What do you expect; there are lots of cryptographers here.

## But then, this one student hacked it!

## And got blocked!

## And then gave a talk about it in the RUMP session!

## And we ended with a series of corny cryptographer jokes!

## It's been great fun!
- I think I've really found home here, and I love the field and the community. I also ran into my ZK mentor, and other professors and postdocs who I have met
along the way, who I would definitely consider doing a postdoc with in the future. I even ran into one of the speakers, who I had met last year! So it's been
lovely!

## This is my last week of my internship
- It's my last day tomorrow, but I still do have some things going on; I have reviews to do for one, and have some other stuff, but it's not crazy or anything.
- I want to use it as a time to rest before the semester starts in the following week, but we'll see. I also have to prep for a chapter of a statistics course 
I'm leading for our book club (just one evening, for 45 minutes, using R).

## So I guess
- So I guess it looks like I'm going to be a cryptographer, which is pretty neat. I'm still recovering from a burst of recruitment, so I have to get back
to some people on that, and also am continuing working on the ICLR Co-submitting programme, which has been fun, but definitely showed how badly needed these kinds
of programme are.
- If my syntax is not quite right, it's because I'm multi-tasking; sorry! There's still a lot going on, although I'm winding down. I currently am in 2 meetings
simulataneously. Can't do that in person :)

## And that's it!
