## Lean Proving

## Reading

- I've been reading [Lean Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/natural_deduction_for_propositional_logic.html)
along with Haskellbook. Lean Prover was advice from my friend, Lyle, 
  who runs the PDF FP group. In terms of Haskellbook, I'm doing about a chapter a week, starting out
  with the first. It gives me enough time to really get into Lambda Calculus. I'll be doing this on the evenings, after 
  plugging through my Nanodegree during the day.
  
- There seems to be two versions; one that has a Chapter 3 on Dependent Types, and the one I'm working through. Oh well. 
  
- I know to some it's not important, considering it seems like I'm definitely on the path of becoming 
  a proof engineer, and I like it (I shudder to say this, but many times more-so than my data-analysis
  stuff), I've been giving it a go. 
  
- Data Science appeals to me on a lot of levels (Julia, Python, which I both love), but at the same time,
  I've been hugely drawn by just types and how things work, and just proofs in general. And data is just 
  not as interesting. 
  
## Proofs
- I'm still learning how to prove things, but I'd like to become better at lambda calculus, beta and eta
  reduction in general. Substitution and Reduction.
  
- So I did a bit of this today. The puzzles are really interesting!
